Exam is limited by patient positioning with the patient's chin obscuring a portion of the right apex. Low lung volumes are demonstrated. The heart size is difficult to assess, but is likely within normal limits. The aorta is tortuous. Opacification of the right lung base likely reflects a combination of consolidation with small right pleural effusion. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. There is gaseous distention of the stomach. Severe S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is demonstrated with multilevel degenerative changes. Partially imaged are severe degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint. Remote left-sided rib fractures are again noted.
