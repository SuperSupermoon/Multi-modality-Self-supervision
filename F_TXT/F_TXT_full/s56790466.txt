In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued layering effusion on the right that appears less prominent probably because of a somewhat more erect position of the patient. Left chest tube has been removed. There may be a small pneumothorax, though this is difficult to assess due to overlying bony structures. Little change in the opacification of the left base and subcutaneous gas on the left lateral chest wall.
