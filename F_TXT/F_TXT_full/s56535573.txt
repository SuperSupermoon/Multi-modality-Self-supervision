Compared with the earlier chest radiograph, there has been interval removal of the right-sided pigtail catheter. No change in the right IJ central line. The endotracheal tube projects 3.1 cm above the carina. Multifocal opacities have improved since the prior study. There are likely small bilateral effusions. Incidental note is made of lumbar spinal fusion hardware and an IVC filter.
