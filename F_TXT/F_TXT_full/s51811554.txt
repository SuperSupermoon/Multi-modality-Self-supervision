As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube is in unchanged position. Relatively extensive soft tissue air collection in both left and right cervical regions as well as in the paramediastinal regions and the right chest wall have minimally increased. There is evidence of a minimal air collection in the paramediastinal regions. The pre-existing right pneumothorax has decreased. The pneumothorax is now small. No evidence of tension. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, retrocardiac atelectasis and small left pleural effusion. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
