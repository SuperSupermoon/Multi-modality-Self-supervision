The uppermost of 2 right pleural drainage catheters remains sharply folded, which may account for persistence of the nearby loculated costal hemothorax. The lower tube is angulated, and could be fissural, which would, in turn explain persistence of the basal collection. A lateral view or chest CT scanning would be required to assess the location of the tubes with respect to the pleural fluid collections. Left lower lobe remains collapsed, and moderate left pleural effusion is still present. There is no pneumothorax on either side. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinum is unremarkable and unchanged. Cannula projecting over the right heart is unchanged in position. Tip of the ET tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 7 cm from the carina and could be advanced 3 cm for more secure positioning. Swan-___ catheter ends in the pulmonary outflow tract. Feeding tube and esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.
