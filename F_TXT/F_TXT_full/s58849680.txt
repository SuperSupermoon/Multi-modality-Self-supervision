Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present with minimal interstitial edema. Patchy opacity at right lung base is probably due to patchy atelectasis, but followup chest radiograph may be helpful to exclude an early focus of pneumonia. At that time, the trachea may be reassessed to evaluate whether apparent rightward deviation is due to the effects of slight rightward rotation or due to displacement from enlargement of the left lobe of thyroid gland.
