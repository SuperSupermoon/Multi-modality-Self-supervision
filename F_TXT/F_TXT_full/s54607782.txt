Patient is status post left thoracentesis. A small left apical pneumothorax is seen. Re- demonstration of complete opacification of left hemithorax is seen when compared with previous same-day study. Increase of the leftward mediastinal shift following thoracentesis and small pneumothorax is suggestive of complete left lung collapse along with pleural effusion and tumor. Multiple right lung nodules are again seen and unchanged consistent with metastatic disease. Left bronchial stent is seen again and unchanged in position.
