Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increase in the amount of extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the bilateral chest walls, soft tissues of the neck, and in the pectoral muscles. There is probable pneumomediastinum as well. Bilateral chest tubes are in place. The endotracheal tube is in unchanged position. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach. A Swan-Ganz catheter is in the expected position. No pneumothorax is identified, although assessment is limited given the extensive subcutaneous emphysema. Increased opacification of the bilateral bases is not significantly changed and is consistent with pleural effusion with compressive adjacent atelectasis and. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
