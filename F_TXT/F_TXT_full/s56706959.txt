Moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size since recent post-thoracentesis radiograph of three days earlier. Adjacent opacity in the left lower lobe and lingula may reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion slightly increased in size with adjacent worsening right basilar lung opacity. Otherwise, no relevant short-interval change.
