Endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach with the side port in the distal esophagus, superior to the gastroesophageal junction. Heart size is moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. Perihilar and upper lobe hazy opacities may reflect pulmonary edema. Small left pleural effusion is likely, with the right costophrenic angle and lateral aspect of the right hemithorax excluded from the field of view. No large pneumothorax is identified. Retrocardiac consolidative opacity is nonspecific, possibly pneumonia or aspiration. Left-sided rib fractures appear acute. Remote right-sided rib fractures also noted. The stomach is distended.
