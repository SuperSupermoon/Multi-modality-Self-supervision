Patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities most pronounced in the right mid lung and lower left lung persist. These are unchanged. The heart and mediastinal structures are unremarkable and stable in appearance. The bony thorax is grossly intact. Numerous metallic radio opacities are again projected in the region of the GE junction and upper abdomen. There is no significant change.
