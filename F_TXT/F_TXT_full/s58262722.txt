Lucency underlying the left hemidiaphragm may represent pneumoperitoneum or the stomach bubble. Correlation with left lateral decubitus views of the abdomen could be useful in differentiating between these 2 entities. Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and subsegmental atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Moderate acromioclavicular degenerative changes are noted bilaterally.
