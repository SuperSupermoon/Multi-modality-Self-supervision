Pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and ventricle expected locations. Replaced aortic valve (4 transcatheter approach) is in expected position as well. There is interval progression of bibasal opacities and perihilar opacities most likely consistent with progression of pulmonary edema with potentially some element of infection in particular in the right lower lobe. There is small bilateral pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
