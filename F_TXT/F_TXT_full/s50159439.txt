Endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates at the upper stomach. Left PICC line terminates at the mid SVC. Hyperexpanded lungs suggest underlying COPD. Persistent retrocardiac opacity is consistent with left lower lung collapse and probable layering effusion. There is a small residual pleural effusion on the right, if any. The cardiac silhouette is normal.
