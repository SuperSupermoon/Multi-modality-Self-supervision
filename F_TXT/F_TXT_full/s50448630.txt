AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are much lower, and therefore, bibasilar opacification can be attributed to atelectasis, without excluding pneumonia. Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size and contribute to increased caliber in the upper lung vasculature and mediastinal veins, but there is no pulmonary edema or large pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
