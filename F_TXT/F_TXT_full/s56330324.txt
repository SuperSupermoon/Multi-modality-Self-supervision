AP chest radiograph. Since the prior study obtained 24 hours earlier, there is minimal improvement in the right mid and lower lung consolidation at its superior portion. The left retrocardiac consolidation is still present, although there is potentially mild improvement of the element of atelectasis. The ET tube tip is in place. The apical scarring is unchanged. There is no interval development of pneumothorax or increase in preexisting moderate pleural effusion.
