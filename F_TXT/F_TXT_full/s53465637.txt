Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to multiple prior studies including CT trauma from ___. Multiple healed fractures are noted on the left as well as on the right. No definitive new (acute) fractures are seen currently. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. The angulated deformities of the right third/fifth ribs are not well appreciated on the current examination due to the one-dimensional representation.
