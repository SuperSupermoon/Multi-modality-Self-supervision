In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema are new as well as possible small bilateral pleural effusions. Four known pulmonary lesions, including 2 in the right upper lobe and 2 in the left lower lobe are not well evaluated on this portable chest radiograph. Cross-sectional imaging would be more sensitive for detecting change over time.
