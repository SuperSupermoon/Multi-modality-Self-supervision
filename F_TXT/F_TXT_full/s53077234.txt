AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph ___, read in conjunction with the torso CT on ___: The patient has also had median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement. New opacification at the lung bases is presumably due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Concurrent pneumonia may well be present. Upper lungs are grossly clear. Mild cardiomegaly is increased and there has been an appreciable increase in caliber of both pulmonary arteries. Clinical correlation advised. No pneumothorax. Right subclavian infusion port ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. An epidural infusion catheter ends at the mid thoracic level. Vascular clips or surgical seeds attest to previous thyroidectomy.
