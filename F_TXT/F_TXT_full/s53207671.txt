AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Overlying soft tissue projecting over the mid lower hemithorax partially obscures the view of the cardiac silhouette although it is likely not enlarged. Bibasilar opacities are seen. Additionally, there is a right perihilar opacity, asymmetric to the left, raising concern for underlying infection although asymmetric edema could have a similar appearance.
