A right IJ loops in the vessel with the tip proceeding superiorly towards the head. The tip is beyond the field of view. An enteric tube courses through the esophagus below the left hemidiaphragm and out of the field of view. The ET tube terminates approximately 1.5 cm from the carina. The lung volumes are low. There are bilateral hazy opacities worse at the bases and right greater than left. There is obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and to a lesser extent the left hemidiaphragm likely from a combination of atelectasis and consolidation. Underlying effusion is also possible. Low lung volumes make evaluation of the heart size difficult; however, there is no gross cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax.
