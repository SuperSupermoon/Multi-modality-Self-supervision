Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest is reviewed and compared to the prior study. An aortic core valve projects over the heart and a transvenous right internal jugular pacer follows the expected course and is unchanged in position. Interstitial abnormality is unchanged since ___, but increased since ___, probably due to edema, exaggerated by low post operatived lung volumes.
