Single portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is in stable position as is the NG tube which can be advanced for optimal positioning given side port within the distal esophagus. There is new right IJ central venous catheter whose tip is likely in the upper right atrium and should be withdrawn 3-4 cm for a more optimal positioning. There is no visualized pneumothorax. Remainder of the exam is unchanged, notable for probable bilateral effusions and bilateral parenchymal opacities potentially due to edema versus bilateral infection.
