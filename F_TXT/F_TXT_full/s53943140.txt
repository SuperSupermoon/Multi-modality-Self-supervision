There is moderate to severe pulmonary edema. There is a small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion may also be present. Subtle patchy right upper lobe opacity, underlying the EKG lead, may be due to developing consolidation or confluence of vessels. Repeat with removal/repositioning of the EKG lead may be helpful for further evaluation. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. No pneumothorax.
