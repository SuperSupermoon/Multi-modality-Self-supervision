As compared to the previous radiograph, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been pulled back. The intraaortic balloon pump is no longer visible. The other monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. Unchanged low lung volumes with bilateral areas of parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion on the left. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged signs of mild-to-moderate fluid overload. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
