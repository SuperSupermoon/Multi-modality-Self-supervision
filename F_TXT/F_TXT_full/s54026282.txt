A single portable supine chest radiograph is obtained. Endotracheal tube ends in the mid airway. An enteric tube projects over the stomach. The lungs are well inflated. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggests small bilateral effusions. Aeration of the lungs has mildly improved. Airspace opacities remain in the right lower lobe. Sclerotic changes of the left humerus is unchanged. A nondisplaced right first rib fracture noted on CT is not seen on radiography. Lower thoracic vertebral compression fractures are again seen.
