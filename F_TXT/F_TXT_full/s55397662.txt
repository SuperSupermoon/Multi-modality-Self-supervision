As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged correct position. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left. A small parenchymal consolidation at the right lung base has minimally increased in extent. The location and the presence of further simultaneous left retrocardiac atelectasis suggests that these parenchymal change reflects atelectasis rather than pneumonia. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
