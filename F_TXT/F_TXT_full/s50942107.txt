Heart size is at the upper limits of normal, but unchanged. Mild calcification and unfolding of the aorta is present, similar in configuration to the prior study. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is detected. Rounded density measuring approximately ___.7 mm, at the right base is probably artifact related to the anterior rib end or possibly a calcified granuloma. Incidental note is made of mild curvature of the thoracic spine and background degenerative changes. Slight pleural parenchymal scarring at the right lung apex is unchanged.
