Low lung volumes are present. The heart size is top normal. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour may be due to low lung volumes and supine AP technique. There is upper zone vascular redistribution which may be attributable to supine positioning without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. Mildly displaced fractures of the left lateral sixth and seventh ribs are noted. Degenerative spurring is seen involving the right acromioclavicular joint.
