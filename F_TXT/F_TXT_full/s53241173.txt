Portable single AP view of the chest was obtained. Lung fields are underpenetrated due to patient body habitus. Lung volumes are low. There is pulmonary edema and marked cardiomegaly. Bibasilar opacities are present with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms. Underlying consolidation and/or pleural effusions cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Calcfications of the aorta are again noted.
