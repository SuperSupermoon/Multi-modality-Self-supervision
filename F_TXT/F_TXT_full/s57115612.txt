Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous but unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated. No new focal consolidation, left-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Chronic small right pleural effusion which is loculated along the basolateral aspect of the right hemithorax is similar, as is bi-apical thickening, more pronounced on the right. Post surgical changes are seen involving the right AC joint with a high riding humerus suggestive of underlying rotator cuff disease.
