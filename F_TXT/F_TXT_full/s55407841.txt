An AP upright chest radiograph shows lower position of endotracheal tube on the current study with the tip just over 2 cm above the carina. This is low in location, but at the time of dictation, a followup film has been obtained which shows better positioning. Nasogastric tube is seen with the tip and side hole both off the view of the film. Left-sided IJ central venous catheter tip is at the level of the proximal superior vena cava and the tip may abut the right lateral wall of the SVC. Marked cardiomegaly is again noted. Lung parenchyma remains diffusely hazy without focal consolidation or volume loss.
