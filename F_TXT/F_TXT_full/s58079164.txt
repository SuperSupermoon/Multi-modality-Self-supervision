Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. Left mid and lower lung consolidations are demonstrated as well as most likely present right perihilar opacity. Findings are concerning for pneumonia. The right internal jugular line has been placed with its tip at the level of mid SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
