AP portable upright view of the chest. Cardiomegaly appears unchanged with bilateral small pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis. There is hilar congestion. Airspace opacities in the right mid to lower lung could reflect pneumonia. No large pneumothorax. Densely calcified tracheobronchial tree appears slightly kinked along the superior mediastinum though this is similar to the prior exam. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
