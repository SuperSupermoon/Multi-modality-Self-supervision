Patient remains intubated. A orogastric tube terminates in the stomach, but its gastric courses only measures about 5 cm. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including leftward shift in mild volume loss at the left lung base with patchy associated opacification. Elsewhere, the lung fields remain clear. A small pleural effusion is hard to exclude on the left; no evidence for one on the right.
