Comparison is made to prior study from ___. The endotracheal tube tip has been pulled back and is now 4.5 cm above the carina at the level of the aortic knob, appropriately sited. There remains cardiomegaly and left retrocardiac opacity and bibasilar atelectasis. There is also prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. Enteric tube is unchanged in position.
