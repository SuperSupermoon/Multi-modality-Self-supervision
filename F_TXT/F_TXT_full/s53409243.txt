There are small unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and associated mild-to-moderate bibasilar atelectasis, slightly improved. A left-sided pleural catheter is unchanged in position, ending along the lateral aspect of the lower pleural space. There is no definite pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, allowing for differences in lung volumes.
