AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Moderately severe pulmonary edema is evenly distributed in the left lung. On the right, there is greater perihilar opacification extending into the lower lobe which could be asymmetric edema or concurrent pneumonia. A roughly spherical ___-mm wide opacity filling the apex of the right hemithorax should be considered a lung mass until proved otherwise. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged. Bulge in the left lower mediastinal contour is probably due to hiatus hernia, but could be a paraspinal lesion. Findings discussed by telephone at the time of dictation with Dr. ___.
