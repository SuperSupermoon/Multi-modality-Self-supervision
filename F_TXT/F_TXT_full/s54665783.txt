Right sided dialysis catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no frank pulmonary edema is present. Previously noted patchy opacities in the right upper lobe have improved. There is worsening ill-defined opacification within the left lung base. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Bronchial wall thickening is most pronounced within the left lung base and likely reflective of bronchitis. Areas of callus formation are noted involving multiple bilateral ribs. Partially imaged is fusion hardware within the cervical and thoracic spine.
