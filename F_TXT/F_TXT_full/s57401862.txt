In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification in the right upper zone, with slight elevation of the minor fissure. This is consistent with developing pneumonia with a small element of volume loss. Streaks of apparent atelectasis were seen at the left mid zone. The left base is more opaque than the right, which raises the possibility of a possible consolidative process beginning in this region as well. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat indistinct, which suggests the possibility of some component of elevated pulmonary venous pressure as well. Central catheter is unchanged.
