Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Widespread heterogeneous lung opacities appear relatively similar to the prior exam except for improving aeration in the left lower lobe. There remains an area of cavitation within the right upper lobe. Additional areas of cavitation have been demonstrated on prior CT. Findings are consistent with a multifocal necrotizing pneumonia.
