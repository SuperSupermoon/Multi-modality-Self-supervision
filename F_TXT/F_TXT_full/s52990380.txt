Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. Suture material in the right mid and upper lung, as well as projecting over the right hemithorax, are again noted. There is a right sixth rib partial resection again seen. The left lung is clear, with possible minimal subsegmental left lower lobe atelectasis. There is right pleural effusion, which is overall unchanged in distribution and size. There is extensive scarring in the right lung, which is not significantly changed from prior exam. Please note, given the extent of underlying distortion and scarring, a subtle pneumonia would be impossible to exclude. The overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable. No acute bony abnormalities are seen.
