No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Small subcentimeter dense nodular opacity projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung may represent a vessel on end versus calcified granuloma. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Right paratracheal soft tissue density without indentation on the aorta may represent prominent vascular structure or mediastinal fat. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Degenerative changes are seen along the spine including osteophyte formation.
