As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. The size of the cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged, with a small pleural effusion on the left and a subsequent relatively substantial atelectasis at the left lung base. Mild atelectasis on the right. Mild fluid overload, but no overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of aspiration. Nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube and right subclavian line are unchanged.
