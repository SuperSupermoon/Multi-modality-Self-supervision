AP chest compared to ___, 7:28 p.m. Opacification at the base of the right lung is new, probably a combination of moderate pleural effusion and mild atelectasis. Moderate atelectasis has developed at the base of the left lung, with no more than a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Interval widening of the upper portion of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably due to vascular congestion. Pulmonary vasculature is also more engorged, but there is no pulmonary edema. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery. Right paramedian drain could be either mediastinal or pleural. No pneumothorax.
