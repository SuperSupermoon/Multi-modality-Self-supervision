The endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the carina, as before, but without knowing the position of the head and neck, it is not possible to determine whether this needs repositioning. The enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and curves to the right of the spine, likely in the distal stomach. The patient is status post median sternotomy. A right PICC line has been removed from ___. The lungs remain mildly overinflated without focal consolidation. A small right pleural effusion is present. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged. Healed right rib fractures are again noted.
