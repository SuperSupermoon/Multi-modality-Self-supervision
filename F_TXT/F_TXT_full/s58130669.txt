There are diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, with relative sparing of the upper lung fields, with obscuration of the right and left heart borders as well as the bilateral hemidiaphragm margins. A dense opacification is also seen in the left apex, without tracheal deviation or obscuration of the left spine border. There is also significant irregular pleural thickening in the right apex, possibly secondary to layering pleural effusion. Right basilar plueral calcifications are noted. Cardiac size cannot be assessed due to obscuration of the cardiac silhouette. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Layering pleural effusions are possible. No fractures are identified.
