As compared to ___ chest radiograph, Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed with residual right internal jugular vascular sheath in place. Severe diffuse pulmonary edema is again demonstrated. A worsening area of consolidation is present in the periphery of the right upper lobe and within the adjacent right lower lobe, and may reflect worsening asymmetrical edema or a secondary process such as aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia. Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard. Bilateral pleural catheters remain in place, with increasing small to moderate right pleural effusion.
