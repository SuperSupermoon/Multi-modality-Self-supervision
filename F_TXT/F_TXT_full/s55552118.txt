Relatively low lung volumes. Left basilar opacity is seen which may be due to infection or aspiration. There is a right base opacity to a lesser extent, which may in part be due to overlap of vascular structures; however, additional site of consolidation may be present. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
