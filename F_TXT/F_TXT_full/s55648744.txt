AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained eight hours earlier during the same day. The left-sided basal density that obliterates the diaphragmatic contour and widens the space of the lateral pleura along the chest wall remains and may have even increased slightly. Aerated volume of the left lung appears compromised. Comparison is made with the next previous PA and lateral chest examination of ___. The position of the previously described left-sided chest tube is unchanged, terminates in the axillary area where its final tip is slightly bent in caudal direction. Provided that chest tube drainage is free, one would have expected some reduction in the densities if caused by pleural effusion. One therefore should also consider hematoma formation within the chest wall itself following the thoracic surgical placement of the epicardial electrodes to the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Position of previously described permanent pacer with ICD and right atrial electrode remains as before.
