AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The tracheostomy is in place, unchanged. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. There is mild interval progression of perihilar vascular opacities and indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels that might be consistent with interval progression of pulmonary edema. Bibasal consolidations are unchanged. No interval increase in pleural effusion or development of pneumothorax is seen.
