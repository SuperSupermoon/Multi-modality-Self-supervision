Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Remote right-sided rib fractures are again noted.
