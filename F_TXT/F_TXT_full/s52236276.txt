Interval placement of tracheostomy tube in standard position, with no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Multifocal alveolar opacities have partially cleared in the right mid and lower lung, but have worsen in the left lower lobe. Apparent new area of consolidation in left juxta hilar region is difficult to confirm due to superimposition of external devices. Attention to this region on the repeat radiograph with repositioning of this external support devices would be helpful. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
