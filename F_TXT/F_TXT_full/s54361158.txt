A tracheostomy tube terminates within the mid trachea. A feeding tube courses along the esophagus and terminates out of the field of view, likely within the stomach. The lung volumes are low, which limits evaluation. Opacities are seen at the right lung base with some appearing linear and others containing air bronchograms. No pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion. There is prominence of the central vasculature without evidence for pulmonary edema. The cardiac contour is normal. Prominence of the mediastinum may reflect the presence of an azygous fissure, especially in the absence of symptoms from pathologic widening.
