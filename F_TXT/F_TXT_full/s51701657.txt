Patient is rotated to the left. The cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to left-sided opacity. The aorta appears calcified. There is opacification projecting over the left mid-to-lower lung as well as right basilar opacity. Findings could be due to multifocal infection; however, underlying pulmonary edema is not excluded. Also, underlying left-sided pleural effusion is not excluded. There are multiple left-sided rib deformities which appear likely old. No pneumothorax seen.
