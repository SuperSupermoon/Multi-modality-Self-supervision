The ___ tube is again visualized with the balloon in the mid to distal esophagus. The tip is below the diaphragm distal to the GE junction. The ET tube tip is partially obscured by the ___ tube but is about 2.8 cm above the carina. Right IJ line tip is in the SVC. Right IJ Cordis is in the upper SVC. There are bilateral hazy alveolar infiltrates right greater than left that have progressed compared to the study from the prior day most likely due to pulmonary edema but an underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be totally excluded.
