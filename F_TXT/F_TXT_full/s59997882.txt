Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely top normal. The mediastinal contour appears widened, likely due to low lung volumes, with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is hazy opacification within both lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
