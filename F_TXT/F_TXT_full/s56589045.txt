Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is no free intra-abdominal air. There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the proximal right atrium. This could be pulled back 3 cm for more optimal placement. There is crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings causing atelectasis, particularly at the right base. There are a few air-filled loops of likely transverse colon, stable.
