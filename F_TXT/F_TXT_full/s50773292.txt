Compared to prior, lung volumes are lower. Relative enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely secondary to low lung volumes. The hilar contours have not changed, including prominence on the right corresponding to a enlarged pulmonary vein on chest CT. Right apical opacity also corresponds to prominent venous and arterial vessels. Mild interstitial edema is present. Linear atelectasis in the right lung and retrocardiac atelectasis have increased. There is no pneumothorax.
