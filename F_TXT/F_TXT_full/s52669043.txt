Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild edema. Previously present right upper lobe opacity has resolved, and confluent opacities in the right mid and lower lung on the prior exam have substantially improved. Left retrocardiac opacity is minimally improved, but a worsening opacity is present in the left mid lung region. No definite pneumothorax on this semi-upright radiograph.
