As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have minimally improved. The relatively extensive parenchymal opacities, notably at the right lung base and in the left perihilar areas as well as in the right upper lobe have not substantially changed. No new opacities. Mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema is present. No larger pleural effusions.
