Mild pulmonary edema has redistributed, now exclusively in the lower lobes accompanied by increasing small pleural effusions and probable mild atelectasis. Upper lungs are now clear. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
