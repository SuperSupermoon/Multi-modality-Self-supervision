Comparison is made to prior study from ___ at 11:44 a.m. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 4.5 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a right-sided IJ line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC. There is a left-sided AICD with intact leads. There is a left IJ central line with distal lead tip in the cavoatrial junction. There is some improved aeration of the airspace opacities; however, there remain some more confluent opacities within the right upper lobe and at the left base and left retrocardiac area. There is unchanged cardiomegaly. There is likely a superimposed element of pulmonary edema.
