Comparison is made to prior study from ___. Endotracheal tube, feeding tube and left-sided central line are again seen in unchanged position. There is cardiomegaly. Several minimally displaced left lateral rib fractures are seen. A left retrocardiac opacity is seen and the small left side pleural effusion is present. There is minimal prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings without overt pulmonary edema. Overall, these findings are relatively stable.
