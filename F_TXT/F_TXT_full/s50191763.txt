Increase in retrocardiac opacity on this AP radiograph might reflect atelectasis but pneumonia is in differential. In addition, there is increase in the left perihilar opacity, potentially reflecting pneumonia as well. No pulmonary edema is seen. No large pleural effusion is demonstrated. Lung volumes continue to be low. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
