Portable semi-upright chest radiograph was provided. Lung volumes are markedly low, which limits the evaluation. There is likely a small right pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis is also likely present. The size cannot be assessed. No large pneumothorax is seen. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
