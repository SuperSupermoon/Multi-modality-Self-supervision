1. Interval extubation and removal of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter. Mediastinal drains and left basilar chest tube remain in place. Interval removal of the nasogastric tube. 2. Small bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis. Some other scattered linear opacities in the right and left mid lung likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Right internal jugular introducer sheath remains in place. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours, given differences in patient positioning and lung volumes. Prominent amount of gas within the distended stomach.
