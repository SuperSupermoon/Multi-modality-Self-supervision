The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. The heart size appears to be mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance, though assessment is somewhat limited due to the presence of bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small to moderate on the left. The aortic knob is calcified. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded. Partially imaged is a percutaneous transhepatic biliary catheter.
