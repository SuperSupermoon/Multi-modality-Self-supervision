Again seen is a moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion, not significantly changed from the prior radiographs. There is associated atelectasis, progressed on the left from the prior. No new opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen, though a superimposed process at the left base would be difficult to entirely exclude. There is mild vascular congestion. No pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with calcifications of the aortic arch.
