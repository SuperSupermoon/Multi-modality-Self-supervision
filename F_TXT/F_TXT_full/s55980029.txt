Compared with the prior study, a Dobbhoff feeding tube has been placed. The tip extends beneath the diaphragm and most proximal portion of the radiopaque tip appears to overlie the proximal stomach. The distal most edge of the tube lies beyond the inferior edge of these films. Again seen is a left subclavian PICC line with tip over distal SVC. Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. There is upper zone redistribution hand diffuse vascular blurring. There is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Some patchy opacity is also seen in the right cardiophrenic region and a focal ill-defined opacitiy is seen in the right mid zone laterally. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
