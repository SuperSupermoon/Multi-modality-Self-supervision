There is stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, compatible with mild cardiomegaly. The bilateral hila are normal. There is a suboptimal respiratory effort and low lung volumes. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. The lungs are clear without evidence of focal consolidation. Apparent increased opacity at the lateral margin of the left mid lung likely relates to overlying breast tissue. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or effusion.
