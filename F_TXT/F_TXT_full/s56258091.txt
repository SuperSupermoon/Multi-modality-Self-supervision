The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. The tip of the nasogastric tube projects below the level the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph. A left central venous catheter tip projects over the mid SVC. Low bilateral lung volumes. Increasing hazy opacities throughout the right lung likely reflect a layering pleural effusion. More discrete opacities project over the right lower lung zone and may reflect atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax identified. The size and appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
