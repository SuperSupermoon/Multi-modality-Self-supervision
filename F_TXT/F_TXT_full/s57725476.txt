Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval removal of a right-sided PICC. Moderate to marked cardiomegaly persists. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. There may also be a trace right pleural effusion. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal contours are stable.
