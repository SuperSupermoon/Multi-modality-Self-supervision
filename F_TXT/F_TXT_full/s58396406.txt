A left-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter is present, with the tip in the region of the caval-atrial junction. There appear to be two left-sided basilar chest tubes. There is probably a persistent small left pleural effusion, unchanged since the prior examination. Surgical ___ at the left lung apex are again seen. No new pulmonary opacities, or evidence of recurrence/worsening pneumothorax/pleural effusion.
