Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained with the patient in the supine position. Endotracheal tube now appears to terminate 1 cm above the carina and is considered too low. Right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged. NG tube appears to enter the stomach, but the tip is not visualized. Heart size cannot be accurately assessed due to the AP projection, but and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Mild improvement in right basilar atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
