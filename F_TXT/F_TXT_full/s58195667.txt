Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Since the prior radiograph, bilateral chest tubes, mediastinal drains endotracheal tube, and enteric tube have been removed. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter is advanced into the right pulmonary artery. No pneumothorax. Lung volumes are decreased since the prior exam, exaggerating size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Small bibasilar atelectasis remains. Pleural effusions are small, if any.
