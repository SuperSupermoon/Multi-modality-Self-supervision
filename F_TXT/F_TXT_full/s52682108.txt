In comparison to the prior study, there has been insertion of an endotracheal tube with tip projecting 4.5 cm above the carina in the mid thoracic trachea. An enteric tube is also new with distal tip projecting below the low lower limit of the radiograph. The left chest cardiac device is an unchanged orientation, as are multiple EKG leads, median sternotomy wires, and mediastinal surgical clips. Re-demonstrated is a large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Known right perihilar mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy was better assessed on prior cross-sectional imaging. The left lung is unchanged in appearance, with a persistent left perihilar opacity. There is no left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
