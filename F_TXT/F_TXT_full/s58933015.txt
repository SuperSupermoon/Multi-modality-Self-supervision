AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___ obtained at 05:42 a.m. The tracheostomy is in place. There is new opacity in the left lower lung, most likely reflecting newly developed left lower lobe partial atelectasis. The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The rest of the lungs are clear and there is also no change in the partially imaged cervical hardware within the limitations of this study technique.
