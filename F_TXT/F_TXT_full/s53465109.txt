Compared to the prior film, the left heart border is less well defined and the degree of left base opacity may be slightly more pronounced. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. No CHF. Aside from platelike atelectasis, the right lung and right costophrenic sulcus are clear. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal/ left lung clips noted.
