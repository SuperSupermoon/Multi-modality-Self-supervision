The ET tube ends at 4 cm from carina. The NG tube ends the in proximal gastric cavity, and can be advanced at least 5 cm. As compared to yesterday, the lung volume is largely increased with improvement of upper and mid lung opacification, likely for reduced pulmonary edema. The reduction of heart size is a sign of improved cardica function. Persist linear opacity at the lung bases, especially on the right, likely for atelectasis. Small pleural effusion on the right base. There is no pneumothorax.
