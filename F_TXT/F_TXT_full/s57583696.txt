As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged and moderately enlarged. A left lower lung atelectasis has slightly increased in extent. The ___ of the mediastinum, however, are unchanged and no larger pleural effusions are visualized. Should pericardial effusion be suspected, ultrasound should be considered. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged, except for a pulling back of the Swan-Ganz catheter by approximately 3-4 cm.
