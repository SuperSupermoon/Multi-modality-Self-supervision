Nasogastric tube terminates in the gastric cardia where makes a loop in may terminate in retrograde fashion at the gastroesophageal junction so advancing the tube somewhat may be helpful. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Streaky opacities at the left lung base have decreased and suggest minor atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs remain clear. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
