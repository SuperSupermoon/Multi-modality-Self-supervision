An endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates within the stomach. There are low lung volumes, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. A linear right basilar opacity is most compatible with atelectasis. The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
