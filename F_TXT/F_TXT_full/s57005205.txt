The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There appears to be stenting of a bypass graft. Lung volumes are reduced. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications of the knob. Widening of the right paratracheal stripe is likely due to vascular structures and/or mediastinal fat. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, focal consolidation or pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified, and there are no acute osseous abnormalities.
