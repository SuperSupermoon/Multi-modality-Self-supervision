Left lower lobe consolidation due to pneumonia has grown more radiodense. There is no cavitation as yet. Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged, in this patient with severe emphysema suggesting the new opacification in the right lower lobe could be dependent edema rather than a second focus of pneumonia, but careful imaging followup is indicated. Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. Heart size is normal. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium.
