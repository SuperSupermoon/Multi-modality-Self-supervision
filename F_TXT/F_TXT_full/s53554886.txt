Lower lung opacity due to a combination of effusion and atelectasis now involves the entire left hemithorax suggestive of an increased large left pleural effusion. Two pleural pigtail catheters in the left lower hemithorax are unchanged in position. Increase in the left pleural effusion. There has not been much change in the position of the mediastinum probably due to associated left lung volume loss. Moderate right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis is similar. Upper lung is clear.
