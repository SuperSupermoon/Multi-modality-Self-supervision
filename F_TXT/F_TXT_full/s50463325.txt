As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient continues to be intubated and to carry a Dobbhoff catheter as well as the right central venous access line. The size of the cardiac silhouette and the bilateral areas of atelectasis as well as the pre-existing bilateral pleural effusions are constant. While the radiolucency of the lung on the right slightly decreases, it increases on the left, which suggests a positional effect. No evidence of pneumothorax. No new parenchymal opacities.
