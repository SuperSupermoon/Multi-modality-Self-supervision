CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared to ___ at 8:45 a.m., the PICC line position has changed, with the right subclavian PICC line now coursing cephalad to overlie the lower neck/thoracic inlet. As before, there is cardiomegaly, CHF and interstitial edema. Again seen is a small-to-moderate right effusion with underlying right base collapse and/or consolidation. Increased retrocardiac opacity and patchy opacity at the left base is slightly worse. The degree of interstitial edema is similar or very slightly worse. Note is made of a scout film obtained in the interval between these two films on ___ at 15:07 p.m., which showed a more conventional position of the PICC line with tip over mid SVC. However, this has degraded and needs to be re-positioned based on the current film. Findings called to Dr. ___ covering for Dr. ___ at the time of discovery at 9:58 a.m. on ___ and discussed shortly thereafter (___, phone).
