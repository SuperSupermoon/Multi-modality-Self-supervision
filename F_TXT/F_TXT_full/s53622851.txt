Upright chest radiograph demonstrates no evidence of pneumothorax. Exam is otherwise similar to recent radiograph of earlier the same date, with left thyroid enlargement displacing the trachea to the right with associated coronal narrowing, marked cardiomegaly, and a large hiatal hernia with adjacent left basilar atelectasis and or consolidation and small pleural effusion.
