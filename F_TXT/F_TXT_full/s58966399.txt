A right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the mid SVC. An endotracheal tube terminates 5.4 cm above the carina. The lung volumes are low. A linear opacity at the right pulmonary base likely reflects plate-like atelectasis. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left. There is no pneumothorax. There is central pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt edema.
