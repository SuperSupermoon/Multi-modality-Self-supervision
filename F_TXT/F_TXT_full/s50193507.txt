Extent of pulmonary edema is better demonstrated on the lateral view performed earlier today which shows that the edema is mild, because on the frontal view its severity is exaggerated by the substantial bilateral pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis, probably complete collapse on the left. Heart is top-normal size. There is no pneumothorax. Chest radiograph in ___ showed moderate cardiomegaly comparable the size today, and also substantial left atrial enlargement, presumably unchanged, but more difficult to recognize when the lungs and pleura are abnormal. .
