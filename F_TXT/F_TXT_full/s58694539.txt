CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. The tracheostomy tube is in place. There are diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar infiltrates, with increased retrocardiac density. There is obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm, which I suspect reflects some layering pleural fluid superimposed on the diffuse process. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but stable. Incidental note is made of degenerative changes in both shoulders and in the lower cervical spine. Compared with ___ at 14:33 p.m. the overall appearance is similar, though the right hemidiaphragm is less well seen on the current exam.
