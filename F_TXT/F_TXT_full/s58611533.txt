The right subclavian PICC line, right neck vascular stent and tracheostomy tube are unchanged in position. Note that the tracheostomy tube continues to have its tip approximately 1.5 cm above the carina. Surgical clips overlying the right axilla and right hilar region are again seen. There are layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities ,most likely reflecting atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
