There has been interval removal of a nasoenteric catheter. A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction or just below. A peritoneal drain terminates in the left upper quadrant, unchanged from prior. Multiple surgical clips are seen in the region of the epigastrium. A thoracic spine epidural catheter is in unchanged position. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Lung volumes are low, though no confluent consolidation is identified. There is a rounded well-circumscribed lucency in the medial left lung apex just superior to the aortic knob. The position and morphology are suggestive of air in the esophagus, though follow-up radiograph is recommended to exclude progression. There is no large pleural effusion. No pulmonary vascular congestion or interstitial edema is identified. There is mild blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles suggestive of small effusion, unchanged.
