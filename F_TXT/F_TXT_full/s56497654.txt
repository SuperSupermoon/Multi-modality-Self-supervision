1. Left dual-lead pacer remains in place with the lead terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. There is prominent calcification of the aortic knob and descending aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. The heart remains stably enlarged. There is persistent essentially unchanged layering and bilateral effusions and patchy airspace disease in both lungs suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema, although diffuse pneumonia could also have this appearance. Clinical correlation is advised. Asymmetric left apical thickening is again seen and may reflect loculated fluid. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
