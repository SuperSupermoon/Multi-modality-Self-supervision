AP chest compared to ___: Moderately severe pulmonary edema accompanied by progressive vascular congestion and worsening severe cardiomegaly developed between ___ and ___. Today, the edema has improved slightly, but in the meantime moderate left and small right pleural effusions developed and are slightly larger today than on ___. Right perihilar consolidation has been worsening since early on ___. Since it nondependent, it is most likely pneumonia, although occasionally acute mitral regurgitation can produce focal edema in the right upper lobe. I doubt that this would continue to worsen while edema elsewhere has improved. Lung bases are also much less well aerated. I attribute this on the left to worsening atelectasis in the face of increasing pleural effusion, but on the right, it could be another focus of pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
