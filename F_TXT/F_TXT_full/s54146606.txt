Very large right pleural effusion persists, despite 2 right thoracostomy tubes, and is probably responsible for considerable atelectasis in the right lower lung, also unchanged. Large cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Mild vascular congestion in the left lung is unchanged, but left infrahilar consolidation has increased, most commonly due to atelectasis. Left pleural effusion is minimal if any.
