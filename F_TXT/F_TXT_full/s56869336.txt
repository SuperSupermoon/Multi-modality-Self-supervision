AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 4:02 p.m.: Interstitial abnormality throughout the left lung is new since ___ and is almost certainly pulmonary edema. There is greater opacification in the right lung, both in the axillary region of the upper lobe and at the right lung base. The latter is a common manifestation of asymmetric pulmonary edema, exaggerated by overlying small-to-moderate right pleural effusion. The upper lobe component could be edema as well, particularly if the patient has mitral regurgitation, but raises the possibility of concurrent pneumonia. Heart is top normal size. No pneumothorax. Large lung volumes, despite the presence of edema is probably an indication of emphysema or air trapping. Note, subsequent chest radiograph showing clearing of edema in all locations dispenses with the notion of possible concurrent pneumonia.
