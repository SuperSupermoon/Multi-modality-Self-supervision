A portable frontal chest radiograph redemonstrates the nasogastric tube in the mid neoesophagus, a right chest tube, and a right chest drain, all unchanged in position. Unchanged lucency under the diaphragm mostly represents distended colon, as well as possibly a small amount of postoperative pneumoperitoneum. Mediastinal widening is decreased, without evidence of mediastinal fluid collection or unexpected distention of the neoesophagus. Bibasilar atelectasis is improved. A tiny probable effusion is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
