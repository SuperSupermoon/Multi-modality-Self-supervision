There has been interval placement of an ET tube which terminates 4 cm above the carina. There is a new NG tube or OG tube with distal tip in the stomach. There is stable position of a right-sided central line with distal tip projecting over the lower SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The bilateral hila are not well visualized. The lung apices are not included on the current radiograph. There are bilateral more central and lower lobe predominant airspace opacities as well as indistinctness of pulmonary vascular margins, consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema, though improved in comparison to prior radiograph. There is increased retrocardiac and left basilar opacification obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, as well as continued, but slightly less prominent, right lower lung opacification, probably representing bibasilar atelectasis. The left lateral CP angle is not clearly visualized, and may represent small/minimal pleural effusion. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
