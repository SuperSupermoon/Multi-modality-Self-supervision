As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly. Calcifications of the aortic wall at the level of the arch. Deviation of the trachea to the left, partly caused by the position of the head. However, a retrosternal goiter could be present. No pleural effusions.
