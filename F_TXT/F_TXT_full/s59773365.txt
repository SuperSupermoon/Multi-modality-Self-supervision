1. Left subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Right chest tube remains in place. No pneumothorax. Layering bilateral effusions, associated patchy airspace process, most likely representing compressive atelectasis and resolving pulmonary contusion at least on the right in the setting of multiple right-sided displaced rib fractures. Overall, airspace process seems to be improving. No pneumothorax is seen. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning between studies.
