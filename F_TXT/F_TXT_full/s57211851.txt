1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the proximal SVC. There continues to be a layering right effusion with associated airspace opacity at the right base suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. Remaining lungs are grossly clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax appreciated.
