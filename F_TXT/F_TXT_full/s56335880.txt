In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is a right chest tube in place with no evidence of pneumothorax, though there is apical pleural capping consistent with pleural fluid. The band of opacification in the right mid to lower lung could represent collapse of a long segment or possibly fluid in the major fissure. The left lung is essentially clear.
