As compared to the previous radiograph, the radiographic evidence of the known pneumomediastinum, documented on previous chest x-rays and on the CT examination from ___, has decreased in extent and severity. A small lucent line along the left heart border is still visualized, likely representing a small pneumopericardium. The monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube and the left-sided PICC line are in unchanged position. There is an increasing right lower lobe parenchymal opacity, as seen on the previous CT examination, representing atelectasis. The left hemithorax is unremarkable. The size of the cardiac silhouette is within the normal range. Free air in the soft tissues is still seen, notably in the left cervical region.
