Lung volumes are low. No definite focal consolidation is seen. Subtle retrocardiac opacity may be due to technique, though PA and lateral radiographs would be useful to rule out developing process. No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is present. The heart size is normal. Apparent widening of the mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes and positioning, though the presence of adenopathy would be impossible to exclude. Again, PA and lateral radiographs may be considered for further evaluation. Findings communicated via the ED QA system at 8:00 pm ___.
