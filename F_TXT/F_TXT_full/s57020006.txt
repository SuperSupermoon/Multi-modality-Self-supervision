Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The endotracheal tube and feeding tube have been removed. There is a right IJ central line with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is again seen a left retrocardiac opacity which may be due to atelectasis or underlying pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen at the lung bases. There is some prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings, which has developed since the previous study. Degenerative changes of the bilateral shoulders are present. Surgical clips are seen overlying the left axilla.
