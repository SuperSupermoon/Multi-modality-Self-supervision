CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 2:22 a.m., multiple lines and tubes have been removed. A left subclavian indwelling catheter tip is unchanged, overlying the SVC/RA junction. Otherwise, no significant change is detected. Again seen is hyperinflation and parenchymal scarring. Relative lucency at both apices is stable and may reflect bullous change.
