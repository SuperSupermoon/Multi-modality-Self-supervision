Substantial progression of large right lower lobe consolidation consistent with worsening pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly improved and pulmonary vascular engorgement resolved. No pulmonary edema. Pleural effusion small on the right if any. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement. Left PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric tube would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt traverses the right neck chest and upper abdomen, passing out of view.
