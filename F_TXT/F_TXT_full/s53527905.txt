Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. Lung volumes are low which limits the evaluation. Crowding of bronchovasculature at the lung bases likely accounts for the relative increased opacity. The overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable. In this patient with known bony metastatic disease, evaluation is limited on this chest radiograph.
