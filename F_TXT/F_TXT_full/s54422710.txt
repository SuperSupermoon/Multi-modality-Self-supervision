Single supine view of the chest demonstrates diffuse right-sided abnormalities with opacities obscuring the mediastinal and hilar contours, similar to the prior study. New right upper lobe opacities are present. Overall , this is likely a combination of effusion and pulmonary edema redistributed compared to the prior study, but superimposed pneumonia can also be considered. On the left, there continues to be a left-sided pleural effusion as well as edema. Cardiac size is enlarged. The patient is status post median sternotomy.
