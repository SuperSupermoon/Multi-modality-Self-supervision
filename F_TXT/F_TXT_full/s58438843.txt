In comparison with the study of ___, the tracheostomy is in place without evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. There is retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, again consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe. The lateral aspect of the left base has been excluded from the image, so that the degree of atelectasis and pleural effusion in this region are difficult to assess. On the right, there is some increased opacification at the base consistent most likely with atelectatic change.
