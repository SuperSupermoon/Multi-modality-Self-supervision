The patient has been extubated. The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is a moderate to large pleural effusion on the right, possibly increased in size, although a confounding factor is different positioning, so it is difficult to be certain as to whether there has been any real change. There is probably a small pleural effusion on the left. More conspicuous is retrocardiac opacification obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, a typical appearance for atelectasis although not specific.
