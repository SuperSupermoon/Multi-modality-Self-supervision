As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. There is pronounced increase in diameter of the perihilar and most central pulmonary vessels, suggesting moderate pulmonary edema. Coexisting hilar lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded. A small lucent line paralleling the right heart border is unchanged since the previous examination. Moderate bilateral atelectasis. No larger pleural effusions. Moderate cardiomegaly. Findings should be followed with radiograph in short term interval.
