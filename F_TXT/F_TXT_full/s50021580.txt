Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiac size is normal. Extensive multifocal diffuse bilateral lung opacities have improved in the right upper lobe. There is no pneumothorax. Small left effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. ET tube is in standard position. Left IJ catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. The small right effusion is unchanged.
