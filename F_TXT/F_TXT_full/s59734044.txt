1. Probable cardiomegaly, with prominence of the left ventricle. 2. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. 3. Atelectasis at the left base. No definite focal infiltrate at the left base. If clinically indicated, a lateral radiograph and/or comparison to prior radiographs could help to assess for subtle left base infiltrate. This would also allow for better assessment of the left ventricular contour, which is somewhat atypical on these views. 4. Otherwise, no focal opacities suggest pneumonia. Comparison with any previous (outside) radiographs could help for further assessment.
