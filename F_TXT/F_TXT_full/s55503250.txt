There has been interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating at the cavoatrial junction, without evidence of pneumothorax. There are relatively low lung volumes with persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Prominence of the right hilum is stable. Bilateral perihilar prominence may be due to vascular engorgement. Right mid lung linear opacity may be due to atelectasis and small effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
