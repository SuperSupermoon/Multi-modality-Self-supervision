Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size appearing mildly enlarged. The aorta is mildly tortuous. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Known air collection within the right anterior pleural space likely reflective of a pneumothorax is not well seen on the current exam. The remainder of the lungs appear unchanged. There is no large pleural effusion. Contrast from the recent CT is noted within the collecting systems.
