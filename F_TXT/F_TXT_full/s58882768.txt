Again seen is a pigtail-type catheter along right chest. Increase in degree of kinking near the chest wall is noted, but could be an artifact of positioning. Clinical correlation requested. There is atelectasis at the right lung base, overall similar to prior. No effusion. No obvious pneumothorax is detected. Right axillary clips are noted. On the left, there is subsegmental atelectasis at the left base, slightly more pronounced. No CHF or frank consolidation detected on either side. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
