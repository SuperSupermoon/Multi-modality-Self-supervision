As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a Dobbhoff catheter. The catheter is mildly coiled in the stomach, with the catheter tip directed towards the gastroesophageal junction. The course of the catheter is normal. Pre-existing coiling of the catheter in the esophagus is no longer present. No evidence of complications, no other relevant changes.
