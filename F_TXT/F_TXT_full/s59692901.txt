A left internal jugular central venous catheter and right subclavian hemodialysis catheter are in unchanged positions with the tips in the upper SVC and right atrium, respectively. A Dobbhoff tube is present with the tip partially imaged, likely in the stomach. A right chest tube with the tip at the apex and a left chest tube with the tip at the base are in unchanged position. Since prior exam, the left apical chest tube removed. There is likely a small pneumothorax at the left base near the insertion site, which is not unexpected after chest tube removal. Linear opacities along the track of the chest tube are likely from indentations of the pulmonary parenchyma. There is otherwise no significant change in the lungs. There is no new consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
