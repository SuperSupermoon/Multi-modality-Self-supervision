A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. An endotracheal tube terminates appropriately 5 cm above the carina. The tip of a right internal jugular central line is in the low SVC. There is an EJ line in the right neck. An orogastric tube tip is in the stomach. Sternal wires and mediastinal clips reflect prior thoracic surgery. There has been a resection of the medial right clavicle. The lungs are well expanded. Central bronchovascular cuffing is more evident compared with the exam this AM. A well-circumscribed left lower lobe nodule was not clearly seen on the prior radiograph. This opacity is near, but not clearly associated with an anterior rib end. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax. There are no abnormal cardiac and mediastinal contours.
