Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study and given portable technique, it is difficult to assess for interval change in the appearance of the large predominantly right-sided mediastinal mass. There is alveolar infiltrates in bilateral lower lobes that have increased compared to the prior study with increased volume loss and probable small bilateral effusions. There is minimal pulmonary vascular redistribution. Compared to the prior exam, the appearance of the lungs in the lower lobes is much worse, an infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
