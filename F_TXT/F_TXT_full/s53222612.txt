Moderately well inflated lungs with unchanged diffuse interstitial edema. Previously noted increased lucency at the left costophrenic angle is unchanged, in appearance compared to the prior radiograph obtained earlier on the same day. Given that there is no apical pneumothorax on this upright view - this may represent a summation shadow or a loculated pocket of air rather than free pleural air. Endotracheal tube tip terminates at the level of the clavicles, enteric tube terminates in the stomach and left PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction as before.
