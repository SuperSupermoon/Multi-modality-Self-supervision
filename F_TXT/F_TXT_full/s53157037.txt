New leftward shift of the mediastinum suggests progressive consolidation at the left lung base is due at least in part to atelectasis which could be caused by aspiration or retained secretions. Moderately severe pulmonary edema in the right lung, milder in the left lung, accompanied by moderate right and slightly smaller left pleural effusion, unchanged. No pneumothorax. ET tube, right internal jugular line, and nasogastric drainage tubes are in standard placements respectively.
