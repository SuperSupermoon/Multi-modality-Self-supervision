Since 2 days prior, bilateral parenchymal opacities have minimally improved. Appearance on today's radiograph appears more consistent with moderate pulmonary edema rather than multifocal pneumonia. Silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm may be due to a combination of pleural fluid, atelectasis, or consolidation. Crease lucency at the lateral left lung base is consistent with a persistent left basilar pneumothorax, best appreciated on CT chest dated ___. Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.
