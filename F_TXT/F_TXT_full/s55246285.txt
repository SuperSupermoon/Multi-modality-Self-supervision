There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly, with a unfolding of the aorta. There is mild vascular plethora, consistent with mild CHF. Faint increased opacity at the left lung base could reflect presence of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The appearance is similar to ___, although slightly improved. Linear atelectasis at the left base is also noted. There is minimal subsegmental atelectasis the right base. No gross effusion seen on either side, though the costophrenic angles are not sharply defined.
