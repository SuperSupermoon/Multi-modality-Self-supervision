The endotracheal tube sits 5 cm above the carina. An endogastric tube courses inferiorly towards the stomach. Clips project over the left hemi-abdomen. There has been interval extension of the previously described thoracic fusion hardware. The heart size is stable given positioning and technique. The right mediastinal contours are exaggerated by patient's rotation to the right. The lung volumes are low with a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis. Retrocardiac atelectasis is also seen. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present. There is no large pneumothorax.
