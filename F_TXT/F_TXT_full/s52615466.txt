Interval placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. A right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the mid SVC, unchanged. Slight interval improvement in lung volumes with improved aeration at low lung bases. Focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could reflect a tiny pleural effusion versus pleural thickening.
