Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC. There are parenchymal opacities throughout both lungs, most prominent within the right upper lobe and left base. Some of this may be due to atelectasis and is also likely superimposed scarring. This is unchanged since the previous study. There are no pneumothoraces.
