Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Rounded lingular opacity consistent with patient's known lingular mass is again seen, better evaluated on CT. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, as are the hilar contours. Mild left base linear atelectasis is seen.
