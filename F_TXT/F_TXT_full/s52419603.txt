A portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates an appropriately positioned endotracheal tube, 5.3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube enters the stomach, though side port appears above the gastroesophageal junction. Lung volumes are markedly low. This causes exaggeration of the cardiomediastinal contour as well as crowding of pulmonary vasculature. Bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
