Left subclavian PICC line has been repositioned -- the tip now overlies the distal most SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. An NG tube is present, it extending beneath diaphragm, off film. The sideport overlies the upper stomach, distal to the GE junction. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora. Doubt overt CHF. Again seen is patchy opacity in the right perihilar and infrahilar regions and, to a lesser extent, in the left infrahilar regions. Suspect slight interval improvement in left perihilar opacity. Opacification of the left costophrenic angle is again noted. It is possible this is artifactual, related to overlying soft tissues. No gross effusion. .
