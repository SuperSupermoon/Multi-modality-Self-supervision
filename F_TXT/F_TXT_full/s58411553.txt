AP chest compared to ___: Previous small right pleural effusion and vascular congestion in the right lung has improved. Substantial left lower lobe consolidation is most likely atelectasis. Moderate right pleural or extrapleural bleeding, in the left chest adjacent to multiple overriding posterolateral rib fractures is slightly smaller, and the small left apical pneumothorax barely visible. Mild scoliosis and loss of height in the lower thoracic vertebral body has been confirmed as an acute or subacute compression fracture by MR scanning.
