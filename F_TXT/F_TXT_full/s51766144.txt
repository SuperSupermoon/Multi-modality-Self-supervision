Left PICC tip terminates in the SVC. Low lung volumes are noted. The cardiac silhouette size is unchanged and is mildly enlarged. The aorta remains tortuous. There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema, which appears progressed in the interval. Small left pleural effusion is present. Opacification in both lung bases likely reflects atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. Coronary artery stent is again demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax.
