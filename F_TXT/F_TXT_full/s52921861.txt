In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a VATS wedge resection with the chest tube on water seal. No evidence of pneumonia. Substantially lower lung volumes. At least 1 other right chest tube is present. There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels. Is unclear whether this is related to low lung volumes or some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Prominence of the right hilar region could represent central edema. The possibility of aspiration or infection in this area cannot be definitely excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
