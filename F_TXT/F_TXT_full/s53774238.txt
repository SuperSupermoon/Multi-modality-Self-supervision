As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 1.8 cm from the carina. The tube could be pulled back by another centimeter to avoid accidental intubation of the right main bronchus. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, unchanged appearance of the heart and the lung parenchyma, with sternal wires and post-surgical material in situ.
