Portable chest radiograph is provided. ET tube is located approximately 3 cm above the carina in appropriate position. An NG tube courses right to the GE junction and should be advanced. There is no pneumothorax. There is a retrocardiac opacity with decreased lung volume on the left consistent possibly due to left lower lobe atelectasis. There may be a small left pleural effusion. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears shifted towards the left unchanged since the prior exam and may be due to volume loss on the left. Osseous structures are intact.
