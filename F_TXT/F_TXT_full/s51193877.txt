The proximal end of the left PICC line is seen approaching the left chest cage, however, the distal end of the PICC line is not clearly visualized within the chest cavity and as such, placement cannot be assessed. The mediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. No pneumonia or pneumothorax.
