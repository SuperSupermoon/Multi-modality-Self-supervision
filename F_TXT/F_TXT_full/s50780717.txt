One semi-erect portable AP view of the chest. There is a linear opacity in the left lower lobe that may represent atelectasis or early pneumonia. The right lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion. The apices are slightly obscured by the patient's chin; however, no definite pneumothoraces are seen. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
