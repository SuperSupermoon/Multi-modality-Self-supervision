Right internal jugular catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. Right costophrenic sulcus is excluded from the image. Lungs are low in volume. Aside from atelectasis at the right lung base, the right lung is well aerated. The left lung is slightly better aerated than on the prior study with minimal decrease in left pleural effusion though some of it appears to be collected in a nondependent location, perhaps within the major fissure. Mild cardiomegaly is noted and slightly decreased from the prior study. Median sternotomy wires as before.
