Assessment is slightly limited due to patient rotation. Allowing for this, the cardiac silhouette size appears borderline enlarged, unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly similar with mild atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is re- demonstrated.
