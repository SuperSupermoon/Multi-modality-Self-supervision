In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse prominence of interstitial markings that could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or both. Hazy opacification at the right base is consistent with layering effusion. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm suggests some volume loss in the left lower lobe. Dense apical opacification in the right apical region most likely reflects pleural calcification from old granulomatous disease. There is a vague suggestion of some increased opacification in the left upper zone. This could possibly be a manifestation of developing consolidation.
