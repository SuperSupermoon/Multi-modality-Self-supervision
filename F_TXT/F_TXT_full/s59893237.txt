There is a persistent opacity at the left lung base which likely reflects atelectasis, as seen on prior chest CT. There is persistent mild cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax is identified. Calcifications of the aortic arch and descending aorta are again noted. Rounded opacity projecting over the right apex is likely external to the patient.
