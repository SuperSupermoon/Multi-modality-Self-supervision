Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There has been worsening of the pulmonary edema since the previous study, there is a cardiomegaly and increased size of the vascular pedicle. There are more confluent opacities within the lung bases that is likely due to pulmonary edema; however, underlying infiltrate is not entirely excluded. No pneumothoraces are seen.
