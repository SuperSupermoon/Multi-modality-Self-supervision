1. Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, esophageal probe, left internal jugular large-bore catheter, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not visualized on the current examination. Bibasilar airspace consolidations with associated effusions, most likely reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Lung volumes are slightly lower than on the previous study. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax is appreciated. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
