AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Heart size remains unchanged and is within normal limits. No pneumothorax identified in the apical area. Previously identified right-sided PICC line remains in unchanged position, but less visible as central guidewire has been removed. No evidence of new acute pulmonary infiltrates and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. Thus, no evidence of new acute pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusion as can be identified on single AP portable chest view.
