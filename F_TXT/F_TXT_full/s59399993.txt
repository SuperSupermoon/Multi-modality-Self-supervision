Lung volumes are slightly improved over the prior exam, no definite consolidation or edema is noted. Again seen is an ill-defined density which projects at the intersection of the anterior right third and posterior right seventh rib. This remains of unclear etiology but is reassuring given that it again is situated over osseous structures. The aorta remains markedly tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged even accounting for patient and technical factors. Both findings are stable. No definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine and in the right shoulder.
