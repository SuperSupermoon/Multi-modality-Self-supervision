Single portable view of the chest. Interval placement of right-sided pigtail pleural catheter is seen. There is mild kinking likely at the chest wall insertion. Fluid seen layering within the chest. No definite pneumothorax is seen; however, this may be due to positioning, as fluid is seen layering the right hemithorax suggesting that this film is at least in part supine, limiting evaluation for subtle residual pneumothorax. The left lung remains clear. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips again noted.
