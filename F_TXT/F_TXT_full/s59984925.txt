The bilateral diffuse airspace process does not appear to be significantly changed and relatively spares the left lower lung. Findings would be consistent with severe pulmonary edema or hemorrhage. Clinical correlation is advised. Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Status post median sternotomy with stably enlarged heart. Stable probable small pleural effusions. No pneumothorax appreciated.
