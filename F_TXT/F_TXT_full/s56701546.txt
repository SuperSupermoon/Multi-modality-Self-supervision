Following left thoracentesis, a left pleural effusion has decreased in size with only a small residual effusion remaining. There is no visible apical pneumothorax, but it appears that the radiograph was obtained in a semi-upright rather than a fully upright position, thus reducing the sensitivity for pneumothorax. Curvilinear band-like opacities in the left mid and lower lung peripherally probably correspond to pre-existing areas of linear scarring in this region noted on older chest x-ray and CT scan from ___, but it is difficult to exclude co-existing basilar loculated pneumothorax given recent thoracentesis. With this in mind, a fully upright chest radiograph or right lateral decubitus radiograph of the left lung may be helpful. Moderate sized partially layering right pleural effusion is difficult to compare to the prior radiograph due to positional differences. Heart is upper limits of normal in size and note is made of pulmonary vascular congestion and mild perihilar edema.
