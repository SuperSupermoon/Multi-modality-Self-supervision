CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 5:54 a.m., the bilateral pigtail catheters have been removed. The Dobbhoff-type catheter is still present with radiopaque tip over stomach. The left subclavian PICC line is present, with tip over distal SVC. No reaccumulated effusions and no obvious pneumothorax is detected at this time. There is mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF. Minimal patchy atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region and slight increased retrocardiac density is unchanged. A focal ~___.9 mm nodular density is seen in the left mid zone measuring immediately above the left anterior fourth rib, near its intersection with left posterior seventh rib. This is not fully characterized, but may correspond to an area of atelectasis seen on the ___ chest CT (2:31). Attention to this area o n follow-up films is requested.
