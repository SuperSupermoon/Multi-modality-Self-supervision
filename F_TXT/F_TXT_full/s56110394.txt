Right-sided chest tube is unchanged in position. A very small right apical pneumothorax is now visible. Diffuse subcutaneous emphysema and mild pneumomediastinum are unchanged. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by increasing pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by mild perihilar edema. More confluent opacities at the bases could reflect dependent edema, but differential diagnosis includes aspiration, atelectasis, and evolving infection.
