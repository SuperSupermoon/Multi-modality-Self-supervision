Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Heterogeneous opacities are again seen within the right upper and mid lung fields, findings which appear worse in the interval, and likely reflect a combination of known metastases and worsening infection and/or aspiration. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged and there is no pneumothorax. Patchy opacity in the left lung base also reflects known metastases with probable superimposed infection or aspiration. Metallic stent is seen in the region of the common bile duct with multiple clips noted in the right upper quadrant. Extensive vascular calcifications are noted within the left upper abdomen. Marked degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are seen with right anterior shoulder subluxation and 2 soft tissue anchors projecting over the right humeral head.
