Comparison is made to previous study from ___ at 2:14 and from 8:26 a.m. There is unchanged cardiomegaly. There is a left-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC. There are again seen airspace opacities, most confluent within the lung bases, right equal to left. There is prominence of pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of overlying pulmonary edema. No pneumothoraces are identified. Overall, these findings appear stable.
