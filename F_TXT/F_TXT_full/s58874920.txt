There has been interval removal of 2 right-sided chest tubes. Again seen is a small right apical pneumothorax, minimally larger compared with the prior film. There is minimal atelectasis at the right base and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, without gross effusion. Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the right and upper left lungs. No definite slight left apical pneumothorax. Left base atelectasis and blunting of the left costophrenic angles again noted, similar to prior. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, with a prosthetic valve and mediastinal surgical clips, is probably unchanged, allowing for technical differences. Again seen is a thin catheter curving over the mediastinum with its tip adjacent to the left clavicular head, unchanged.
