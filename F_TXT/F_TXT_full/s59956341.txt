AP chest compared to ___: Progressive elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is responsible for more left lower lobe atelectasis today. Whether this is due to diaphragm dysfunction or displacement by a subphrenic space occupying process would require either imaging of the left upper abdominal quadrant, or observation of left hemidiaphragm motion, both of which can be achieved with ultrasonography. Lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusion minimal on the left if any. Of note, a recent chest CT, ___, showed the elevated left hemidiaphragm, secondary atelectasis, but no pleural effusion or left upper quadrant space occupying pathology. Presumptively, the left hemidiaphragm is dysfunctional either because of phrenic nerve palsy, previous diaphragmatic trauma or senile degeneration (eventration).
