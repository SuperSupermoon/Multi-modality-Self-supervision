Left subclavian PICC line is visualized with the tip at upper SVC. Tracheostomy tube is visualized in position. An enteric tube is visualized with tip traversing through the stomach but out of the field of view. Small left pleural effusion as well as a tiny right pleural effusion, stable in comparison to prior study. There is, however, improved aeration of bilateral lower lobes with less atelectasis. Destructive lung parenchyma and bronchiectatic changes in the left upper lobe appear stable.
