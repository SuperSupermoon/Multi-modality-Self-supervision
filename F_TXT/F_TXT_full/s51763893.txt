The cardiac silhouette is prominent, but likely accentuated by AP technique. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta with arch calcifications. Rightward displacement of the trachea is unchanged since multiple prior exams. There is mild perihilar vascular engorgement without frank edema. There may be segmental atelectasis in the left base, and a small left effusion cannot be excluded. A moderate hiatal hernia is present.
