AP chest compared to ___ 5:05 p.m.: Chin is down and now the endotracheal tube ends above the upper margin of the clavicles, and should be advanced 2.5 cm for better positioning. Left internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC as before and nasogastric tube passes in the stomach and out of view. Lung volumes are low now than earlier, and mild interstitial edema has developed. Lung bases are largely obscured by the elevated diaphragm. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
