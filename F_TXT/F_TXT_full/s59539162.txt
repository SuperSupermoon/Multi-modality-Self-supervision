Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a left pectoral cardiac pacer with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiac silhouette is mildly prominent, accentuated by slightly decreased lung volumes. The thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous. There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or vascular congestion.
