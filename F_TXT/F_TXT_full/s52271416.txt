1. The patient is status post median sternotomy with stably enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours. Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the proximal SVC. Left basilar chest tube remains in place. Stable left apical lateral pneumothorax. The nasogastric tube has pulled back and now its tip in the upper esophagus. Repositioning or removal would be recommended. There is patchy opacity at the left base, which may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. There are likely small layering effusions, left greater than right. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Linear opacity in left mid lung likely reflects scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. The patient's nurse, ___, was notified by phone on ___ at 11:57 a.m. of the need to reposition the nasogastric tube. She informed me that the tube has subsequently been removed.
