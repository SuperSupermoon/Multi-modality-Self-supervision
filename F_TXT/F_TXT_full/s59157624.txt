AP chest compared to ___: Although the right lower lobe is abnormal, its appearance has changed very little since ___ and it has been a site of recurrent peribronchial infiltration over the years. Presence of new septal lines at the right base and persistence of those on the left suggests there may have been intercurrent pulmonary edema, probably resolving, since heart size is normal and mediastinal veins are not dilated. Dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Overall, findings do not suggest pneumonia or even appreciable aspiration.
