Bilateral pleural effusions have markedly increased. Underlying consolidations most likely represent atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded. Curvilinear density projecting above the meniscus of the right pleural effusion likely represents atelectasis, but cavitation cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is difficult to evaluate in the setting of overlying effusions. There is no mediastinal widening. Aortic valve replacement hardware is seen. Pacing hardware appears similarly positioned on this view. Sternal wires appear intact. Mediastinal clips are noted.
