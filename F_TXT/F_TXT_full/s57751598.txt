AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the day earlier. The ET tube tip is 5.6 cm above the carina. There is gradual progression of the right lung consolidations, highly concerning for widespread infectious process. Left basal linear opacity is unchanged. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen. Bilateral pleural effusion is most likely present.
