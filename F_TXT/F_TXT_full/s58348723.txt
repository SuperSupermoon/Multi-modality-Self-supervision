Left -sided PICC tip terminates in the low SVC. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinal contour is similar. There is persistent enlargement of both hila compatible with enlarged bilateral pulmonary arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is continued moderate pulmonary edema, unchanged, with small bilateral pleural effusions, perhaps slightly larger on the left in the interval. Ill-defined patchy opacities within the upper lobes may reflect coexistent multifocal pneumonia, better assessed on the previous CT. Patchy atelectasis is also noted in the lung bases. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is demonstrated.
