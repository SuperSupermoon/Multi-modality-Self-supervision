The lungs are mildly hypoinflated. Multiple rounded opacities are seen throughout the left hemi thorax projecting at the end of ribs and may represent old rib fractures with pleural thickening. Rounded opacity at the right hilum likely represents main pulmonary artery on end. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mildly prominent heart is related to patient positioning and lung volumes. Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
