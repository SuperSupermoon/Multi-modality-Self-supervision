Patient is rotated to the left. There has been interval placement of the tracheostomy tube which terminates projecting over the trachea. Subtle external linear structures are projecting over the chest. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable. There has been interval removal of endotracheal and enteric tubes. Right lung opacity due to pleural effusion and atelectasis appears mildly improved, although this may relate to differences in patient position. Left retrocardiac opacity is grossly stable, indicating left lower lung collapse. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
