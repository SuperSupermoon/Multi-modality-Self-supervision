Hazy opacity in right mid and lower hemi thorax could potentially be due in part to pleural thickening in this patient with evidence of previous chest wall trauma. Coexisting right lower lobe consolidation is also possible in the setting of a history of recent right lower lobe pneumonia. Further evaluation with dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
