Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. An enteric tube is seen coursing to the left of midline into the medial left lower hemithorax and does not traverse below the diaphragm. The tube is in inappropriate position and its presence is may be within a left lower lobe airway versus within a tortuous distal esophagus. Recommend removal and replacement. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.2 cm above the level of the carina. It is difficult to exclude trace pleural effusion, although no large pleural effusion is seen. There is left basilar atelectasis. There is prominent biapical scarring. Ovoid calcific structures project over the left upper hemithorax which may represent calcified granulomas or other calcification. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified.
