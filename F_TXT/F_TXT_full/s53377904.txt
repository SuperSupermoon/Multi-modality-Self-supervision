Mild cardiomegaly is stable compared to the most recent prior exam. The lung volumes are low exaggerating the hilar and mediastinal contours, which, aside from mild dilatation of the ascending aorta, better characterized on the prior CT, are unremarkable. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is persistent. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. Left-sided pacer leads terminate in appropriate position. Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of a pneumothorax.
