Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in size, in keeping with known pericardial effusion on prior CT of earlier the same date. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits allowing for relatively low lung volumes. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated with adjacent lower lobe atelectasis, left greater than right. Right pleural effusion may be slightly larger than on the prior study, but positional differences could also potentially influence this appearance.
