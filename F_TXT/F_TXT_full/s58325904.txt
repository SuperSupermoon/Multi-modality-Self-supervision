Left lung is still collapsed. Left hemi thorax is uniformly opaque aside from small bubbles of retained air in the left pleural space. Volume of left pleural effusion is indeterminate, but probably considerable common despite the left pleural drain. A small right pleural effusion persists, pleural drain in place. Heterogeneous opacification in the right lower lobe could be due to recurrent aspiration and/or pneumonia.
