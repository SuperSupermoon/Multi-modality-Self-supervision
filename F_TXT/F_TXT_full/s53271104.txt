As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Massive right pleural effusion with subsequent consolidations at the right lung bases and in the right mid lung. As compared to the right changes, the left lung appears relatively normal, with currently no evidence of focal opacities and no larger pleural effusion. The size of the heart is unchanged. Unchanged endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular vein catheter.
