Again seen is a left subclavian PICC line with tip over mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Chain sutures again noted at the left lung apex. The patient has a known hiatal hernia. Triangular density overlying the cardiac silhouette is more pronounced on today's examination and could reflect atelectasis. If clinically indicated, a lateral view could help to further characterize this. Minimal patchy opacity at right lung base is slightly increased. The differential diagnosis includes atelectasis, early pneumonic infiltrate or possible site of aspiration. Minimal blunting the right costophrenic angle is new and suggests a small right effusion.
