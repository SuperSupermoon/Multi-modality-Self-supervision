Comparison is made with prior study performed 3 hours earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacity, larger on the left side are better seen in prior CT. There is no evident pneumothorax. Multiple left rib fractures and left clavicle comminuted fracture are again noted. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Left perihilar opacity is unchanged.
