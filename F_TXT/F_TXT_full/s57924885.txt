There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube tip terminating approximately 5.8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip appears to be within the stomach. Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Worsening streaky opacities in the lung bases bilaterally most likely reflect increased atelectasis, although aspiration remains a concern. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
