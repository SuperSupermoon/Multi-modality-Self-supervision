A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is new retrocardiac opacification and possibly a very small right-sided pleural effusion. A small subpulmonic effusion on the left is also possible. A cavitary lesion persists in the left upper lobe although not optimally assessed. Ground glass opacities noted recently in the right upper lobe are not likely to be well appreciated on portable radiography.
