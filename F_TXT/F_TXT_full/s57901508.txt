As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The course of the right-sided PICC line is constant. Areas of atelectasis are seen at both the right and the left lung bases, but no new focal parenchymal opacities are present, in particular non-potentially suspicious for pulmonary infection. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
