AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Poor inspirational effort results in high-positioned diaphragms even more marked than on the next preceding portable chest examination of ___. Heart size cannot be determined. There is no obvious pulmonary vascular congestion but the crowded appearance of the basal pulmonary vasculature is seen bilaterally, somewhat more marked on the left side. No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical areas and no new acute parenchymal infiltrates can be identified. Similar as on the next preceding portable chest examination, the basal lung portions are obscured and the question concerning acute pneumonia as the cause of the patient's post-operative fever ca'nt be answered on this technically limited single view chest examination. If diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrate is essential for patient's management, I recommend additional lateral view.
