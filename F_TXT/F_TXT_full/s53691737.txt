A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette, with interval mild decrease in a left pleural effusion. Left base atelectasis is likely related to a combination of pleural effusion and resultant atelectasis. There is no new focal consolidation, or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
