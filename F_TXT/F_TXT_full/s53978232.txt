The heart size is normal. The aortic knob is calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are unremarkable. The lungs are hyperinflated with relative lucency in the lung apices compatible with mild underlying emphysema, better demonstrated on the prior CT. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. There are no focal opacities, pleural effusions, or pneumothoraces. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
