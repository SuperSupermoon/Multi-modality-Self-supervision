As compared to recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, marked persistent cardiomegaly is now accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion. There are no focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia. If there is persistent clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism, a dedicated CT angiogram of the chest may be considered if warranted clinically.
