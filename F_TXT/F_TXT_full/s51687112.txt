Interval development of prominent perihilar opacities suggest pulmonary edema. The opacities are right-greater-than-left which may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema although infectious process is not excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Bilateral calcified pleural and diaphragmatic plaques suggest prior asbestos exposure. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by portable, AP technique. If concern for acute aortic/mediastinal process, chest CTA would be more sensitive.
