New endotracheal tube and transesophageal drainage tube are in standard placements. No central venous catheter noted. No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Heart is moderately enlarged. Lung volumes have increased following intubation. Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has a nodular component. If this is pulmonary edema it suggests underlying lung disease, such is emphysema. Alternatively there may be pulmonary edema as well as pulmonary nodules and I note vascular clips in the right axilla often seen with nodal dissection for breast carcinoma. Nodules could also be infectious. Pleural effusions are small. No pneumothorax.
