Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. There has been interval improvement in the widened mediastinum. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral small effusions are largely on the left side. Lines and tubes are in unchanged position. Still the NG tube has the side hole at the EG junction. Pulmonary edema has almost resolved. Bibasilar atelectases have improved, larger on the left side. Sternal wires are aligned.
