1. Single-lead right-sided pacer remains in place with the tip projecting over the expected location of right ventricle. The heart remains stably enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion could have this appearance. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. A patchy opacity in the right upper lobe persists and may represent an area of aspiration or pneumonia. There continues to be perihilar vascular fullness and some interstitial prominence which likely reflects improving, but persistent perihilar and interstitial edema. No large effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
