Moderate pulmonary edema is demonstrated with small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded. There remains mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pneumothorax is identified.
