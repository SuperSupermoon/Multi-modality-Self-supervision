New endotracheal tube terminates 7.4 cm from the carina and should be advanced for optimal positioning. The enteric tube extends below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view within the stomach. Heart is upper limits of normal in size accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema. Evaluation for pleural effusion is somewhat limited as the costophrenic angles are excluded from the field of view. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Right lower rib deformities suggest remote prior fractures.
