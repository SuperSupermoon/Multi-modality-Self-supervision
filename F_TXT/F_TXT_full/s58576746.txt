AP portable upright view of the chest. Again noted is a left arm PICC line with its tip residing in the SVC. No orogastric tube is visualized. In the upper abdomen, an IVC filter is noted. In the lower lungs there is interval development of subtle hazy opacity which could represent atelectasis though the possibility of an early consolidation cannot be excluded. The upper lungs appear clear and well-aerated. No large effusion. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
