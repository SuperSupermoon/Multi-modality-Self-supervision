The patient is status post endotracheal intubation. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube passes into the stomach and terminates to the right of midline within the right upper quadrant, near the expected pylorus, possibly in the distal antrum or pyloric channel. There is mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Mildly prominent perihilar opacification suggests slight congestion or fluid overload, but not striking. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The left costophrenic sulcus is excluded.
