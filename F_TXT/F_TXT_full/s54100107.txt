Slightly rotated positioning. Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. There is mild prominence the cardiomediastinal silhouette, which is similar to 1 day earlier, allowing for differences in positioning. There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with mild vascular plethora. There is hazy opacity along the right lung base, with obscuration of the right cardiophrenic angle, new compared with the film from 1 day earlier -- the appearance is more suggestive of a small effusion than an area of focal consolidation. The small lateral right base nodular density seen on the prior film is obscured by this new confluent density, probably incidentally (i.e. the 2 findings are not thought to be related). No other focal opacity and no left-sided effusion identified. Minimal atelectasis noted at the left lung base medially. Incidental note is made of advanced degenerative changes in both shoulders, not fully evaluated on this film.
