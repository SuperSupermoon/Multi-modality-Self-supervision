Right pigtail chest tube catheter has been removed. There has been interval reaccumulation of a moderate right pleural effusion. Rightward shift of mediastinal structures is re- demonstrated, and heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the pleural effusion. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications are noted of the thoracic aorta. There is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Right basilar atelectasis is demonstrated. A small left pleural effusion appears relatively constant. Streaky opacity in the left lung base also reflects atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected. Multiple remote left-sided rib fractures as well as proximal and distal left clavicular fractures are again visualized.
