There is stable moderate cardiomegaly. There is a right-sided IJ which terminates in the mid SVC. There is a left-sided pacemaker. Again opacification of the right base medially persists with some obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. This could reflect merely crowding of vessels; however, pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. This, however, appears overall stable compared to the prior exam. Again seen is bibasilar atelectasis as well as a small right pleural effusion. There is mild right pulmonary edema. The hilar and mediastinal contours appear stable. There is no pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
