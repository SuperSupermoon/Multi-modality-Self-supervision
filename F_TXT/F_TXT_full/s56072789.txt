The nasogastric tube extends to the lower body of the stomach, before coiling and back on itself and facing upward at the mid to upper gastric level.

In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. Multiple large calcified lymph nodes are again seen in the neck.
