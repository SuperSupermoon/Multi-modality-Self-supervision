A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates opacification of the left hemithorax, with minimally aerated lung is seen at the left apex. This is consistent with increased severe left pleural effusion. The right lung is clear, without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated secondary to overlying opacity in the left hemithorax.
