Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The Dobbhoff tip is malpositioned, continuing towards the right main bronchus. This position was corrected as demonstrated on the subsequent radiograph obtained 5 minutes later. The right internal and right subclavian central venous lines are in unchanged position, terminating at the level of superior SVC and right atrium respectively. The replaced mitral valve is in expected position. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. The patient appears to be increased pulmonary edema as compared to the recent radiograph, associated with bilateral pleural effusions.
