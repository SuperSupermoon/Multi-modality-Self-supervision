Since the prior radiograph of ___, the patient has been intubated with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 3.2 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Patchy left lower lobe opacity is probably due to atelectasis although aspiration and an early focus of pneumonia may produce a similar radiographic appearance.
