The heart is normal in size. The aortic arch is calcified. The right hemidiaphragm is moderately elevated. The colon appears interposed beneath the right hemidiaphragm which probably explains lucency beneath the diaphragm. On the left side, there is a small pneumothorax. The distance between the superior pleural edge and the chest wall is about 14 mm. The lungs appear clear. There is no pleural effusion. There is a very mildly displaced posterior lateral left eighth rib fracture.
