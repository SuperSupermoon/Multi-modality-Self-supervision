The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart size remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contour is unremarkable and unchanged. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is improved compared to the previous exam. Retrocardiac streaky opacity likely reflects atelectasis. Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus suggests that there may be a trace pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint with joint space narrowing and osteophytic spurring is present.
