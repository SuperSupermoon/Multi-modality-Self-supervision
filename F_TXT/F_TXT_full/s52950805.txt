In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is increasing opacification at the left base, most likely reflecting atelectatic changes and small pleural effusion. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base. Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in size. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
