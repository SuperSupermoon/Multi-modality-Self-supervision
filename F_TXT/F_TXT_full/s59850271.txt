There is a slightly decreased, but moderate-size pneumothorax. Small amounts of subcutaneous emphysema persist but have not increased. A right-sided pleural effusion has decreased. However, there is increased perihilar consolidation and widespread opacity within the right lower lung, most likely in the right lower lobe. Minimal left basilar atelectasis is noted. There is a calcified nodule consistent with a granuloma in the left mid lobe as well as a few other suspected tiny calcified granulomas. A suture line projects along the right suprahilar region associated with prior right upper lobectomy.
