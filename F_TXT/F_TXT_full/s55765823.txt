Interval extubation and removal of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal drains, nasogastric tube, and right chest tube. Right internal jugular introducing catheter remains in place. No pneumothorax is seen. Patchy opacities at both bases in the setting of low volumes likely reflects atelectasis. Probable small effusions. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. No pulmonary edema.
