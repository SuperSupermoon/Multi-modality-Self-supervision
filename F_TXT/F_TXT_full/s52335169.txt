AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___. It is noted that a chest CT has been performed during this latest examination interval during the late evening of ___. Comparison of the two portable chest examinations demonstrates the presence of a pigtail ending pleural drainage catheter that has been inserted in the lower left lateral chest wall and projects now with the terminating pigtail end close to the vertebral column, presumably located in the posterior pleural sinus. This finding coincides with a marked increase of the left-sided density resulting in a practically complete left-sided white-out of the chest as identified on this single view examination. No pneumothorax can be identified. Position of previously described right internal jugular approach central venous line is unaltered and the degree of mediastinal shift towards the right also appears unchanged. No new parenchymal abnormalities in the right hemithorax.
