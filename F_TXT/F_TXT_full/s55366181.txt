As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. No new parenchymal opacities, no overt pulmonary edema. Mild fluid overload, and atelectasis at the right perihilar lung areas as well as the retrocardiac atelectasis, potentially combined with a minimal left pleural effusion. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged right shoulder calcifications.
