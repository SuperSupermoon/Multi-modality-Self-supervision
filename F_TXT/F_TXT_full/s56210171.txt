The lungs are hyperinflated. Biapical scarring and increased interstitial markings are seen throughout the lungs likely due to patient's underlying COPD. There is no focal consolidation worrisome for infection. Nodular opacity projecting over the anterior right fifth rib which may represent the nipple shadow in should be followed on subsequent exams. Calcified densities projecting over the right axilla are presumably in the soft tissues. Additional adjacent calcific densities projecting over the right lateral lung are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Atherosclerotic calcifications again noted at the aortic arch.
