A right dual-lumen central venous catheter terminates in the proximal right atrium. The left PICC line terminates in the right atrium, possibly within the right ventricle as was noted yesterday. A new nasogastric tube has its tip projecting over the stomach. The tip turns and head cephalad but appears to be within the stomach. Lung volumes are low, resulting in mild vascular crowding not significantly changed. The heart is top normal. The retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and may represent atelectasis or small pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
