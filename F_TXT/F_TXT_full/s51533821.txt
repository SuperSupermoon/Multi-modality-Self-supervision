Tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 5.3 cm above the carina, nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm (side port not confidently visualized), and right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Patchy and linear juxtahilar and bibasilar opacities are nonspecific, but most likely represent atelectasis. Multifocal aspiration is an additional consideration given the history of suspected overdose. Diffuse hazy opacity throughout the right hemithorax compared to the left is probably due to an artifact due to lack of centering of the patient. However, layering pleural effusion could produce a similar radiographic appearance.
