As compared to the previous radiograph, the intra-aortic balloon pump has been advanced. The tip of the pump is now located 1.7 cm be low the aortic arch. The other monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube as well as right internal jugular vein catheter are in unchanged position. The right pleural effusion appears to have minimally increased in extent, the left pleural effusion has also slightly increased. Both effusions cause more atelectasis at the lung bases than on the previous image. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
