New almost complete whiteout of the right hemi thorax with shifting of the cardiomediastinal structures to the left is due to a massive right pleural effusion. Pigtail catheter projects in the right lower hemi thorax. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. The vessels on the left are engorged. The left hemidiaphragm is also obliterated suggesting left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis
