As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right internal jugular vein catheter. The tip of the catheter projects over the mid to low SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other complications. The patient is rotated, causing a projection induced increase in radiodensity at the left lung bases. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. The previously seen skin folds projecting over the left hemithorax are no longer visualized.
