The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no pulmonary edema. The heart is normal in size, and the mediastinal contours are normal. No displaced rib fractures are noted. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
