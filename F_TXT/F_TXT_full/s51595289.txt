In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, the cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are persistent findings. Although atelectasis at the left lung base has improved in the interval, heterogeneous opacities in the right upper and mid lung have worsened. The latter could reflect multifocal aspiration, asymmetrical edema, or rapidly developing infection. As some of the right lung opacities have a somewhat nodular configuration, short-term followup radiographs or CT may be helpful to exclude septic emboli.
