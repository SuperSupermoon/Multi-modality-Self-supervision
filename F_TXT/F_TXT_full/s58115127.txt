Endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position. An enteric tube terminates within the stomach. A new right internal jugular catheter is positioned within the lower superior vena cava. Improved aeration of the right upper lobe is noted, suggestive of interval improvement in right upper lobe collapse, though persistent opacity is present. There is no pneumothorax. Patchy opacity in the right lower lobe persists, possibly aspiration or atelectasis. Volume loss in the right lung is manifested by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Airspace opacities are worse in the left lung base and may represent aspiration. The left upper lung is better aerated in comparison to 8 AM today. Small right pleural effusion is noted.
