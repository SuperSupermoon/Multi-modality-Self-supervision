Left upper lobe has partially re-expanded, lower lobe still collapsed. Leftward mediastinal shift is accordingly less pronounced, but still obscures the cardiac contours. Atelectasis in the right middle lobe is probably responsible for the elliptical opacity contiguous with the minor fissure. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion is small if any. ET tube is in standard placement, ECOM cannula ends in the IVC as before. Transesophageal drainage tube passes into the nondistended stomach and out of view. Left jugular introducer ends several cm above the thoracic inlet.
