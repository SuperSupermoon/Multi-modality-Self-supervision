Portable frontal chest radiograph shows no significant change in previously described left lung opacification and volume loss, compatible with collapse, with elevation of a probably paralyzed left hemidiaphragm. The right lung remains clear. Further evaluation with CT would provide a better evaluation of the airways to evaluate for cause of collapse.
