The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, including mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The heart is normal in size. Pleural effusions have resolved. Lung volumes are low, and in that setting predominantly streaky basilar opacities may be seen with atelectasis. Developing pneumonia is possible, however, particularly at the left lung base where opacity is more ill-defined. There is no pneumothorax.
