Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. There is extensive bilateral pulmonary airspace consolidation which is most compatible with multifocal pneumonia. Bilateral small pleural effusions are seen, left greater than right. No pneumothorax. Multiple coronary stents project over the heart. The heart size is difficult to assess though appears grossly unchanged. Aortic atherosclerotic calcification noted. Bony structures appear intact.
