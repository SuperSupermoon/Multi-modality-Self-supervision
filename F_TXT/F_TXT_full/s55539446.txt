1. There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and pneumomediastinum. Increasing pneumoperitoneum, which is concerning. Dr. ___ was notified of this finding on ___ by phone at 12:05 p.m. and stated that the patient has subsequently undergone exploratory surgery. There is a right chest tube in place. A right internal jugular catheter and dual-lumen catheter remain unchanged in position. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet and the nasogastric tube is coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach and the sideport near the gastroesophageal junction, unchanged. Lungs are grossly clear. There is likely a small right apical pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given marked patient rotation on the current examination.
