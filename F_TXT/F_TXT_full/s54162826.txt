AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. Patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. An NG tube can now be identified, seen to reach just below the diaphragm. A right internal jugular approach central venous line terminating in mid portion of SVC unchanged. No pneumothorax has developed. The previously described basal densities suggestive of some pleural effusions appear unchanged. No evidence of new infiltrates or major atelectasis. Thus no radiographic suspicion for mucus plugging of the central airways.
