In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. There are substantially lower lung volumes with some prominence of the cardiac silhouette and engorgement of pulmonary vessels suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification in the retrocardiac region is consistent with volume loss. There is elevation of the minor fissure with some opacification in the right upper zone. This could be a manifestation of volume loss with chronic changes, though the possibility of the supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There is also some increased opacification lateral to the left hilum and aortic arch. It is unclear whether this could represent an area of consolidation as well. There is substantial prominence of the transverse arch of the aorta and the descending thoracic aorta measuring up to almost 6 cm.
