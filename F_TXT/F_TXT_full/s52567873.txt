Single frontal view of the chest. Severe thoracic dextroscoliosis is similar to prior with a stable appearance of mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal contours. Interstitial markings are diffusely increased with mild cephalization of vessels, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Ill-defined bilateral lower lung opacities are nonspecific and could represent atelectasis or infection. No pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion.
