The edge of the lung parenchyma is seen in the right apex consistent with a slight interval increase in size of the right apical pneumothorax. However, the horizontal fissure appears to extend all the way to the pleural surface and lung markings are seen extending to the apex. The appearances suggest this may be a small loculated pneumothorax. Otherwise, the 2 right upper lobe mass like areas are unchanged with 2 fiducials in-situ. Calcified breast prostheses again noted. The left lung appears clear. .
