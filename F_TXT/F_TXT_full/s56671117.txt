AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study dated ___. During the latest examination interval, the patient has undergone right-sided thoracocentesis. Patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. The previously identified right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line has been adjusted and withdrawn so that it now terminates 2 cm below the level of the carina. This indicates mid position of the SVC. The evidence of bilateral pleural effusions blunting the lateral pleural sinuses and diaphragmatic contours persist and is even more marked now on the right side than it was before. The left-sided pleural effusion is as marked as it was before. On this portable AP chest examination, there is no evidence of any pneumothorax in the apical area on either side.
