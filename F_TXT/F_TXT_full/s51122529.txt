As seen on the frontal view, there may have been some improvement in the component of right pleural effusion in the lower posterior chest, while the fissural components are slightly larger. PA and lateral views are recommended because they are more informative. The right basal pleural pigtail drainage catheter is unchanged in position. Right lung abnormality is relatively mild, probably basal atelectasis. Left lung is clear and there is no left pleural abnormality. Heart is moderately enlarged, chronically. Transvenous right atrial and biventricular pacer leads continuous from the left pectoral generator. No pneumothorax
