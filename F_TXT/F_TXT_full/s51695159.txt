Since the prior exam, via a right internal jugular sheath, there is a transvenous pacer coiled in the right atrium. The tip is pointing downward and may be at the junction of the right atrium and IVC. The endotracheal tube and gastric tube are in unchanged position. The inspiration is slightly improved in comparison to the prior exam. There are persistent bilateral interstitial opacities, consistent with mild edema, which appear slightly improved. There may be a small effusion on the right. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
