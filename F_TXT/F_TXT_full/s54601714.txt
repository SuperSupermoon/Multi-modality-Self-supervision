Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. Large left pneumothorax is identified with rightward deviation of the mediastinum concerning for tension physiology. No acute rib fractures are identified although subtle fracture could be missed, with old right rib fractures and small right pleural effusion or pleural scarring noted. Cardiomediastinal contours aside from slight rightward shift are unremarkable.
