As far as one can tell on an isolated bedside frontal chest radiograph, lungs are clear. Depending on the clinical concern for occult lung infection, CT scanning would reveal findings not apparent on this study, as demonstrated previously by compared conventional chest radiographs to concurrent CT scans in late ___. Heart is normal size. Fullness in the azygos region of the right paratracheal stripe is a persistent finding and is due to distended azygos vein. Left central venous line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
