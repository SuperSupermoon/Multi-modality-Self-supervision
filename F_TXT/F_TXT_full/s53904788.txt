The lung volumes are low. Opacities within the lung bases, left greater than right, is unchanged compared to recent prior examination and may reflect persistent atelectasis or resolving aspiration as suggested by the clinical history. Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests persistent small effusion. The upper lungs appear clear. A known 14 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule is not well seen on this radiographic examination. There is no pneumothorax. No vascular congestion or overt pulmonary edema is identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits and unchanged from prior.
