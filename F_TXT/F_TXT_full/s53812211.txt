The lungs are hyperinflated, likely reflecting chronic pulmonary disease. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The heart is normal in size. A well-circumscribed round opacity along the right heart border may reflect a Bochdalek's hernia. Calcifications are noted along the aortic arch, and no displaced rib fractures are seen. S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is noted.
