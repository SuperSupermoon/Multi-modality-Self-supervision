Hardware is seen overlying the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine which obscures the endotracheal tube on this study. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm. The left subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC unchanged. Patchy opacities are seen throughout the left lung. The right lung is grossly clear. There is persistent opacity in the retrocardiac region with an associated layering effusion likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
