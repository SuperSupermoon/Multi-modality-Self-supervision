Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. Increased interstitial opacity with mediastinal vascular fullness and Kerley B lines is consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema and likely accompanying trace pleural effusions. Bibasilar atelectasis may also be present. Mild cardiomegaly persists with otherwise normal mediastinal and hilar contours. There is no pneumothorax with apical scarring again noted.
