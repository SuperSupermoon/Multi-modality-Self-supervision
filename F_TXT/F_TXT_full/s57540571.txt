Supine portable AP view of the chest is provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located approximately 1.5 cm above the carina. NG tube courses inferiorly with its tip not visualized. Lung volumes are low. VP shunt catheter courses over the right hemithorax. There is relative hilar prominence, likely reflecting crowded bronchovasculature. The possibility of scattered atelectasis and aspiration is difficult to exclude. No large effusion or pneumothorax seen. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
