Left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the regions of the right atrium and right ventricle. Heart size remains severely enlarged, similar to the prior study. Moderate pulmonary edema is worse compared to the prior exam. The mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged. More focal opacities in the lower lobes may reflect atelectasis. Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Assessment of the lung apices is obscured by the patient's neck and chin projecting over these regions, but no large pneumothorax is identified.
