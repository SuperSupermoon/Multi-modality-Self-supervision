1. Right basilar pleural catheter remains in place. There continues to be an apical lateral pneumothorax with increasing aeration in the right lung suggestive of re-expansion pulmonary edema but overall, the pneumothorax has somewhat decreased in size and there is improved aeration, particularly at the right lung base.
