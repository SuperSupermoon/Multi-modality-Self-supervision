Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are relatively low lung volumes. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable given differences in inspiration. There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggesting pulmonary vascular engorgement/pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusions are seen. No evidence of pneumothorax. Surgical hardware is partially imaged at the superior aspect of the image.
