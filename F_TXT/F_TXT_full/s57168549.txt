As compared to the previous study from earlier the same date, the ECMO cannula has apparently been slightly repositioned, now terminating at the expected cavoatrial junction. Swan-Ganz catheter has been withdrawn in to the right main pulmonary artery. Endotracheal tube has apparently been advanced slightly, with tip now 2.1 cm above the carinal with the neck in a flexed position. Bilateral asymmetrically distributed pulmonary opacities appear similar in the right lung but slightly worse on the left.
