AP chest compared to ___, 1:12 a.m.: Large right pneumothorax has increased in size, although there is no appreciable leftward mediastinal shift. Pulmonary edema was mild to moderate but symmetric four hours ago. Now it is clearing from the right lung suggesting diminished perfusion to that side. With the patient supine I cannot exclude some component of left pneumothorax collected anteriorly, though there are no findings to suggest it. Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a stable post-operative appearance, with a degree of widening expected given the pre-operative heart size. There is either a small to moderate left pleural effusion collected superiorly or extrapleural bleeding responsible for thickening of the apical pleural margin. Clinical correlation is necessary. Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation. Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump is no less than 12 cm from the apex of the aortic knob, 4 to 5 cm below usual position. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the region of the pulmonic valve. ET tube is in standard placement. Midline and left pleural drains are also in standard position.
