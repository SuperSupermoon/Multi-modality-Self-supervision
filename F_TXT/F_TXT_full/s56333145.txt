Single portable view of the chest demonstrates interval improvement of interstitial edema and left lung base opacity since the prior study. There is some interval worsening, however, of the right lung base medially, likely representing atelectasis. There is also a small left pleural effusion. The previously seen right and left internal jugular catheters are unchanged in position since the prior exam. There has been interval removal of the nasogastric tube. No pneumothorax is seen.
