As compared to the previous examinations, there is stable opacification of the right upper lobe, consistent with aspiration versus pneumonia. The lung volumes are decreased, which leads to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. The remainder of the lungs are essentially clear without additional focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. An endotracheal tube is noted to be in place terminating 2.8 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen passing into the stomach.
