Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 1.5 cm above carina. Enteric tube tip is below diaphragm, not included on the radiograph. Sternotomy. There is increasing left basilar opacification, with associated volume loss, consistent with atelectasis, with probable component of mildly increasing effusion. Stable right basilar opacification, likely edema. There is stable probably mild right pleural effusion. It is difficult to estimate cardiac size cava left basilar opacification. No pneumothorax.
