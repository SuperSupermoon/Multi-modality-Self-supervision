As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The patient has received an endotracheal tube, the tip projects 3 cm above the carina. The patient has also received a nasogastric tube, the tip of the tube is not visible on the current image. The course of the tube is unremarkable. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The left-sided PICC line is unchanged. Unchanged cardiomegaly. Extensive basal atelectasis. The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The signs indicative of mild fluid overload are constant.
