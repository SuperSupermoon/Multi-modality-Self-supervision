In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, there remains widening of the right superior mediastinum, consistent with extension of known hematoma from the neck. Exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening left lower lobe collapse with adjacent persistent small left pleural effusion. Atelectasis at the right lung base is also slightly worsened. No other relevant change.
