Interval placement of an endotracheal tube with it tip 4.2 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A right subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. There are layering bilateral effusions with patchy air space disease in both lungs suggestive of worsening moderate pulmonary edema given the interval change. A diffuse infectious process could also have this appearance and therefore clinical correlation is advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. A dual left-sided pacemaker remains in place. Prominent calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. Asymmetric left apical pleural thickening is stable and may represent some loculated fluid.
