The patient is rotated towards the right and the lung volumes are noted to be low. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. There is no lobar consolidation, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or overt pulmonary edema identified. A slightly asymmetrically prominent right hilum is likely secondary to patient rotation. Borderline cardiomegaly is stable but there is no real pulmonary vascular engorgement and certainly no edema. Calcifications are noted at the aortic knob.
