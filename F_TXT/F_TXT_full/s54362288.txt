In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. The tip of the tube is closely facing the right lateral wall of the trachea. There are extremely low lung volumes that may account for much of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Mild engorgement of the pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Areas of increased opacification at the bases most likely represent atelectasis and small pleural effusions. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Of incidental note is a large amount of fecal material within dilated transverse colon. This could reflect a fecal impaction.
