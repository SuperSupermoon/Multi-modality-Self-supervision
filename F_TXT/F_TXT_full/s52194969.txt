There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube, enteric catheter and Swan-Ganz catheter with remaining right-sided central venous sheath terminating likely at the confluence of the right internal jugular and subclavian veins. Left-sided mediastinal and chest tube drains have been removed without development of pneumothorax. There is persistent but notably improved pulmonary edema with residual bibasilar opacifications likely representing atelectasis. No pleural effusions identified.
