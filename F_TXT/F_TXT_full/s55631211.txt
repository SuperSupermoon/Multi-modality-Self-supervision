CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. Lordotic and slightly rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 6.0 cm above the carina, at the level of the mid clavicular heads. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, curled in the stomach and overlying the fundus, near the GE junction. A left IJ line is present, tip overlying the brachiocephalic vein, left of midline. No pneumothorax is detected. The inspiratory volumes are slightly low. Allowing for this, there may be mild cardiomegaly. There is dense left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with air bronchograms, with increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. Possible trace left effusion. There is diffuse vascular blurring. This may relate to residual CHF. Some patchy opacity is also present in the right cardiophrenic region. No right effusion.
