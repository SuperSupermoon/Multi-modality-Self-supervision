AP chest compared to ___: Since tracheal extubation, lung volumes are lower, pulmonary vasculature has grown engorged, mediastinal veins are dilated and cardiomegaly has worsened, all pointing towards volume overload and/or cardiac decompensation. I do not see lobar collapse, appreciable pleural effusion or large pneumonia.
