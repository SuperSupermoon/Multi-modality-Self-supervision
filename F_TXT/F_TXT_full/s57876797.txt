Swan-Ganz catheter tip is at the level of the right ventricular outflow tract. Right PICC line terminates at the level of the axillary vein, most likely representing a mid line. Cardiomegaly is substantial. Left upper lobe opacity has resolved. Right basal opacity is present associated with pleural effusion. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen. Giving the right mediastinal shift compared to the prior study there is most likely resolution or improvement of left basal atelectasis although interval increase in pleural effusion is a possibility.
