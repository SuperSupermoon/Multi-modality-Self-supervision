Portable frontal chest radiographs demonstrate interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates in the mid to upper thoracic trachea, and an enteric tube which courses below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image. A left chest wall pacer device is unchanged in position. Heart size is likely unchanged. Diffuse pulmonary opacities are increased compared to prior exam. Pleural effusions are incompletely imaged on this exam.
