Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip 3.3 cm above the carina. NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen with its tip just beyond the GE junction. There is effusion on the right, which layers posteriorly. There is a small left effusion. There is vague opacity in the right mid and lower lung, which could represent in part layering fluid, though the possibility of pneumonia is not excluded. Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring is noted. The heart is mildly enlarged. Bony structures are intact.
