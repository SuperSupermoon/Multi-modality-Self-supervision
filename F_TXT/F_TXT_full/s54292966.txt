A pigtail catheter remains in place adjacent to a cavitary right lower lobe lung lesion. Tiny right apicolateral pneumothorax is present, and in retrospect is unchanged from the recent study. New poorly defined opacity has developed in the left infrahilar region, and may reflect atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely a developing focus of infection. Short term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
