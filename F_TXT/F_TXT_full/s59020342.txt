An endotracheal tube is in the high trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. The lung volumes are low. Within the limitations, the lungs are clear without a focal airspace consolidation or pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Allowing for low lung volumes, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
