As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Position of the endotracheal tube, the left subclavian line and the nasogastric tube are unchanged. Nasogastric tube can be well followed along its esophageal course, but is difficult to visualize below the diaphragm. Minimally increased extent of the bilateral pleural effusions, combined to areas of relatively substantial atelectasis. Mild fluid overload is still present. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
