Portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an interval decrease in lung volumes and increased basilar atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is minimally bigger and enlarged, and the pulmonary vasculature is accentuated. However, there is no new parenchymal opacity and no overt pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. An abandoned left subclavian catheter fragment is unchanged. A left IJ approach central venous catheter tip is unchanged in the mid SVC.
