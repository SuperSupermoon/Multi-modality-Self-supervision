AP chest compared to ___, 3:05 p.m.: Most of the opacification in the left hemithorax resolved following re-positioning of the endotracheal tube from the right main bronchus to the distal trachea. Currently, the tip is no more than 15 mm above the carina, and it should be withdrawn another 15 mm for appropriate positioning. A new left basal thin-bore pleural drain has been inserted, and only a small volume of left pleural fluid remains. Right upper lobe is still collapsed. There are numerous metastases in both lungs. The small right pleural effusion is stable. Heart is grossly normal size. Both a left subclavian infusion port and right internal jugular line end in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax.
