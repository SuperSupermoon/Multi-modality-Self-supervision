In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Hazy opacification at the bases silhouetting the hemidiaphragms is consistent with layering pleural effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
