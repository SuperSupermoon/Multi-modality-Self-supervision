A right-sided PICC is in-situ, the tip terminates in the mid to distal SVC. A right internal jugular catheter has been removed when compared to the prior study and the patient has been extubated. There has been significant improved months in aeration of the bilateral lung bases with minimal residual right basilar atelectasis. No pleural effusion seen. No definite consolidation seen. Mild prominence of the right hilum is likely in part due to positioning.
