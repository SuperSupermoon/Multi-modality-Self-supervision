Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding. There is increased heterogeneous opacification seen in the mid and lower right lung fields consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema versus aspiration. Small right-sided pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
