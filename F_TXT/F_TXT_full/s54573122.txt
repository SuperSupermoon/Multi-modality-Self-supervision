Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 5.3 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on this study. There is a left-sided port, distal aspect not well seen, but likely terminates at the proximal SVC/SVC-brachiocephalic junction. There are low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. There is a calcified structure projecting over the right lung apex with what appears to be a wire which was not seen on the prior study four hours prior and may be external to the patient.
