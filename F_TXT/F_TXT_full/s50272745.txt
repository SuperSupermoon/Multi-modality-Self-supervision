AP chest compared to ___: Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has increased, and pulmonary vascular congestion as seen in the left lung has also worsened. There is no definite pulmonary edema. Small left pleural effusion is new. Heart size is normal. What was questioned as paraspinal fluid collection on yesterday's chest radiograph is probably mediastinal venous engorgement along the trachea and this has decreased. A left subclavian line ends centrally. No pneumothorax.
