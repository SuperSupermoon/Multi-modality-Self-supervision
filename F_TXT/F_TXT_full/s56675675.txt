Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present, although the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy and streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. Trace left pleural effusion seen on recent CT is not well assessed on this current exam. There is no pneumothorax. No subdiaphragmatic free air is present. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
