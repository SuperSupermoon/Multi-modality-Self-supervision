1. ET tube slightly high, at the level of the mid clavicles. 2. Right paratracheal density of uncertain etiology or significance. Recommend further assessment with PA and lateral views. 3. Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, but likely accentuated by low lung volumes. 4. The possibility of some background CHF cannot be excluded, but this appearance is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
