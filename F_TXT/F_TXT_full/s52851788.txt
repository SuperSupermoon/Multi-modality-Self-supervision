AP chest compared to ___, 2:26 a.m.: Tip of the ET tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles with the chin down, no less than 44 mm above the carina. It should not be withdrawn any further and could be advanced 15 mm for more secured seating. Mild cardiomegaly is new, as well as a generalized increase in lung density, left greater than right. This is most readily explained by cardiac decompensation and/or volume overload. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. What may be a peripheral catheter ends in the left axilla. No pneumothorax.
