No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Left basilar opacification could merely reflect atelectasis, though in view of the clinical history, supervening pneumonia must be seriously considered. Small nodular opacification at the right base laterally was better evaluated on prior CT scan.
