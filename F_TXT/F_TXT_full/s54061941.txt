Lung volumes have improved, but heterogeneous bibasilar opacification has not. It is not entirely clear whether this is dependent edema or bilateral pneumonia due to recent aspiration. Heart size is clearly normal and mediastinal veins slightly less dilated. Upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is borderline in caliber. Small left pleural effusion stable. No pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads in standard placements unchanged.
