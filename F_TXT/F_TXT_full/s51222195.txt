Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is a stable, small right apical pneumothorax. Increased opacity at the right base without silhouetting of the pulmonary vasculature, right heart border, or right hemidiaphragm suggests a new, layering right pleural effusion. Persistent retrocardiac opacity is consistent with unchanged, left basilar atelectasis. Probable, small, new left pleural effusion. Parallel, linear densities projecting medial to the left humeral shaft could represent a displaced humeral fracture or superimposition of soft tissues. Clinical correlation is recommended and dedicated left humeral radiographs could be obtained.
