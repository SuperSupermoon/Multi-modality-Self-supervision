A portable upright radiograph of the chest was obtained. The exam is limited by motion. The lung apices are obscured by overlying soft tissue. The left costophrenic angle is obscured/blunted, secondary to underlying effusion or atelectasis versus overlying soft tissue. A linear retrocardiac opacity is unchanged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are similar in appearance to ___.
