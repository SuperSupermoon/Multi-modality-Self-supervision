Right internal jugular catheter terminates in the upper SVC. Endotracheal tube terminates 1.2 cm above the carina. Recommend withdrawal of the endotracheal tube by several cm for more optimal positioning. Nasogastric tube extends into the stomach. The median sternotomy wires are intact. There is stable, mild cardiomegaly. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Interval improvement in bibasilar opacities. Apparent increased opacity projecting over the right apex is likely secondary to superimposed external structures. Recommend more symmetric positioning with removal of external structures on subsequent radiographs. No pneumothorax. Interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema.
