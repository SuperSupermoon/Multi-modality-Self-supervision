AP chest compared to ___: The previously small right apical pneumothorax is larger, probably underestimated on this supine view, which suggests pleural air at the base of the right hemithorax is substantial and increased. Also increased since ___ is what is probably pulmonary edema, even though heart size is normal. Small left pleural effusion is likely. There is no left pneumothorax. Azygous distention could be due to supine positioning alone. ET tube and right internal jugular line and an upper enteric trained imaged tube are in standard placements respectively. Resident caring for this patient was paged at 9:30 a.m. and the findings were recognized.
