Enteric tube and left central venous catheter have been removed. Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study. Worsening bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP technique. There is new pulmonary vascular congestion and indistinctness of the pulmonary arteries.
