The heart is severely enlarged, and is larger than on the prior study. There is no significant change in the tracheostomy tube or PICC line. There is marked improvement in the aeration in the right lower lobe, however there is some persistent alveolar infiltrate in the right lower lobe. The right heart border is very distinctly visualized suggesting that there may be a small amount of pneumomediastinum. The right effusion is decreased. There is increased obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm with dense retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. This is worsened compared to the study from 2 days ago.
