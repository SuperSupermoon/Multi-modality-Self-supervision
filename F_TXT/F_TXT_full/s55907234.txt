Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. Stable substantial left-sided pleural effusion and smaller right-sided pleural effusion, both with adjacent atelectasis are unchanged from radiograph earlier today. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax. Right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the cavoatrial junction. Endotracheal tube ends 7 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing into the stomach and out of field of view. Gaseous distension of the stomach is present.
