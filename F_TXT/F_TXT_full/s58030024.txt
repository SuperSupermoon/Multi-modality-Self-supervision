There is minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region medially, probably slightly worse compared with ___. There is minimal atelectasis at the right base, also more pronounced. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. No gross effusion. Small left upper lobe nodule and left upper lobe opacities as well as small pericardial effusion and bronchial wall thickening seen on the CT scan performed 1 day earlier are not well depicted radiographically.
