In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm and blunting of the costophrenic angle. The configuration is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and associated pleural effusion. There appears to be shift of the mediastinum to the left, though some of this could be related to obliquity of the patient port this side. The right lung is clear and there is no evidence of vascular congestion. Gastrostomy tube is in place and there is evidence of an old healed fracture of the midportion of the right clavicle. The right PICC line is been removed.
