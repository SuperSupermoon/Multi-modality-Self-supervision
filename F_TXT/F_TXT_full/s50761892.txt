Left chest tube remains in place with no significant interval change in appearance of the left hemithorax where there is persistent patchy and linear opacity at the left base likely reflecting atelectasis and/or scarring. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent chronic pleural thickening or a small effusion. Several left-sided rib fractures and left scapular fracture are again seen. Improved aeration at the right lung base. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
