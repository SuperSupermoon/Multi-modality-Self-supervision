Left PICC has been repositioned since the prior radiograph but now terminates in the lower superior vena cava. A feeding tube remains in place within the jejunum. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without change. Increasing left pleural effusion is small to moderate in size and accompanied by a left retrocardiac opacity, which may reflect atelectasis and less likely a focus of infection. Right lung is grossly clear.
