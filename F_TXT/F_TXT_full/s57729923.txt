AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The ET tube tip is 4.2 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged. There is left lower lobe lung consolidation demonstrated, unchanged since the prior study, for infectious process. Smaller opacities are noted in the left upper lung and right mid lung, unchanged in the short-term interval. When compared to the prior study from ___, the overall appearance of the findings has been improved on the left, but slightly worse on the right, which might potentially reflect involvement of the right lung by the infectious process.
