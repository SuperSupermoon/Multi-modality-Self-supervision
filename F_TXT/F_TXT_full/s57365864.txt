ET tube in standard placement. Esophageal drainage tube in the neo esophagus can be traced to the level of the diaphragm but the tip is not distinct. Right pleural and mediastinal drains in place. There is at least a small right pleural effusion. Generalized opacification of the right lower lung is due to the neo esophagus projecting over it, but also atelectasis and congestion. Left lung is relatively clear aside from mild basal atelectasis. Heart is top-normal size. No pneumothorax.
