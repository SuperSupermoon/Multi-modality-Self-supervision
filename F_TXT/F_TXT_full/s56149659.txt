Compared with 1 day earlier, the overall appearance is similar. There has probably been slight improvement in the CHF findings, with slightly less vascular engorgement. Patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region and lateralization of the left hemidiaphragm are similar to prior. Low inspiratory volumes are also similar.
