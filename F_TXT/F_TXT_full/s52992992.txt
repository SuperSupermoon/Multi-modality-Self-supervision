There has been interval increase in size of the left pleural effusion which is now large in extent, and appears to be partially loculated over the left apex. There is concomitant left basilar atelectasis. Patchy opacity in the right lung base also likely reflects an area of atelectasis. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence of a pleural effusion. No vascular engorgement is present. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
