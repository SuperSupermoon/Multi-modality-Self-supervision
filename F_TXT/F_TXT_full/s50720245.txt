The patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 3cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is in place and shows a normal course. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal. There is no evidence of pleural effusions or free intra-abdominal air. Most importantly, however, are bilaterally, relatively widespread opacities and consolidations of various sizes, ill-defined, and with air bronchograms. The appearance of the changes is suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. ARDS could be another differential diagnostic consideration. Short-term followup is required, and comparison with previous films would be beneficial.
