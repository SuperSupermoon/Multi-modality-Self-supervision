A Dobbhoff type tube is present. The radiopaque tip lies in the region of the GE junction. The distal most portion of the radiopaque tip overlies the uppermost portion of the fundus. Note is made of a radiolucent segment measuring 16 mm between the tubing and the densely radiopaque tip. Probable background hyperinflation/COPD. Possible mild cardiomegaly. Upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. Large (6.9 x ___.8 cm) opacity the right base is essentially new compared with ___ and there is now a new or slightly more pronounced small right pleural effusion. There is also increased retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms that is slightly worse. The left hemidiaphragm remains visible and no gross left pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax detected. Surgical clips noted in right upper quadrant.
