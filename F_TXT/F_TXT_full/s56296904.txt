Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Large bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side, are probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Bibasilar atelectases, larger on the left side, are stable. Cardiomegaly is obscured by the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is stable.
