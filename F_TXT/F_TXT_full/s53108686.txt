Severe bilateral pneumonia is symmetric enough, with an apparent perihilar increase, to raise question of pulmonary edema, but I think the abnormality is due to infection, since heart size is normal and there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement. Pleural effusions are small, incidental. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses.
