AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Available for comparison is a preceding chest examination dated ___, issued by the ___ emergency room. On present examination, significant cardiac enlargement is seen. The pulmonary vasculature is markedly congested bilaterally with prominent perivascular haze in the pulmonary circulation. The lateral bases are obscured, so are the diaphragmatic contours compatible with bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area. In comparison with the next previous examination obtained one earlier, the pulmonary congestive pattern has markedly increased and the same is too for the bilateral pleural effusions.
