The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valvular replacement. Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with dense atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic knob noted. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is similar compared to the prior study. More focal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region could reflect an area of atelectasis though infection is not completely excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Marked degenerative changes of both acromioclavicular joints are seen. High riding right humeral head suggests underlying rotator cuff disease. Remote right eighth rib fracture is again seen.
