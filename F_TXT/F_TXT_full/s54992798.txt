Compared with the prior study, a three-lead pacemaker is now present. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen are diffuse increased interstitial markings, most pronounced at the bases, with retrocardiac air bronchograms, very similar to the appearance on the ___ radiograph. This apparently relates to a known diffuse interstitial abnormality and bibasilar fibrosis. Prominence of the right hilum is similar to the prior film.
