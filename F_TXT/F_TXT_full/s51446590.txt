Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. Several surgical clips are seen projecting over the mediastinum. There is mild pulmonary interstitial edema with mild cardiomegaly. The hila appear engorged and the interstitial markings are prominent. There are no large effusions or pneumothorax. No convincing signs of pneumonia. The mediastinal contour appears grossly within normal limits with atherosclerotic calcifications again noted at the aortic knob. The imaged bony structures appear intact.
