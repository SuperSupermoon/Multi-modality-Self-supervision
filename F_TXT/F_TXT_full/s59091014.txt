The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple clips noted in the mediastinum. Enlargement of the mediastinal contour is compatible with a massive pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta. The remainder of the mediastinal contour appears unchanged. There is continued moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are present, perhaps slightly decreased in size on the right and increase in size on the left. Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is re- demonstrated.
