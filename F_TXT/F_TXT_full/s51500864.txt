The tip of endotracheal tube ends approximately 8.4 cm above the carina at the level of the clavicles. Consider advancing the ET tube by additional 2-2.5 cm for better seating. Gastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach and is appropriately positioned. An aortic stent graft is present extending from the level of the aortic arch till the mid descending thoracic aorta. Remarkable for engorged pulmonary vasculature and perihilar haziness suggestive of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The heart size is normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
