Supine portable AP views of the chest were obtained approximately 1 hr apart. On the initial radiograph, the patient is intubated with the tip of the endotracheal tube residing 4.1 cm above the carinal. An NG tube courses into the left upper quadrant. On the second radiograph a right IJ central venous catheter has been placed with its tip in the low SVC region. The lungs are hyperlucent reflecting known severe emphysema. No focal consolidation, large effusion or supine evidence for pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinal contours appear normal. Bony structures are intact.
