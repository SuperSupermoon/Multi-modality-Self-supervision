In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. Again, there is substantial elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour. Low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. There is some ill-defined vascular structures suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Atelectatic changes are seen at both bases, especially on the right. In the appropriate clinical setting, a developing consolidation at the right base would have to be considered. The opaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube may straddle the esophagogastric junction. If clinically possible, the tube should be advanced several centimeters.
