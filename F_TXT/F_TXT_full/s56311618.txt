There has been interval removal of a left internal jugular line. A left subclavian catheter terminates at the origin of the SVC. An endotracheal through the terminates 3.2 cm above the carina. Finally, an esophageal tube terminates in the stomach and should be advanced 3 cm for appropriate position. There is minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement with no evidence of pulmonary edema. A right mediastinal asymmetry is again seen, and is unchanged. Bibasilar opacities are minimally worse from the prior study but likely reflective of atelectasis. Small pleural effusion on the left. No pneumothorax is identified.
