Patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic and mitral valve repair. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. Mediastinal contours are similar. Moderate pulmonary edema is not substantially changed. More focal opacities within the lung bases, particularly within the right lung base, may reflect areas of superimposed infection. Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right, are not substantially changed. No pneumothorax is present. Degenerative spurring is noted within the imaged thoracic spine.
