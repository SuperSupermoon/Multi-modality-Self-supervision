ET tube tip is 5.1 cm from the carina. There is a left basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. Elsewhere, lungs are essentially clear besides left basilar atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Increased soft tissue density projecting over the AP window is compatible with patient's known dissection with mediastinal hematoma. No acute osseous abnormalities.
