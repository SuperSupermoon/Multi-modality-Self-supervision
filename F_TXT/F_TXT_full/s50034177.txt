There is a small left apical pneumothorax. There is no right pneumothorax. Heterogeneous opacities bilaterally, particularly along the left heart border may represent atelectasis or sequela of contusion or potentially edema. Minimally displaced left fifth, sixth, and seventh rib fractures are noted. Right posterior seventh rib fracture is also mildly displaced. Heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Planning of the left AC joint may be chronic.
