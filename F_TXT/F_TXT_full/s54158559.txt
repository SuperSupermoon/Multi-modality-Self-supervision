Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval intubation with ET tube terminating 3.5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube extends inferiorly out of view into the stomach. There is persistent perihilar vascular congestion with more confluent bilateral lower lobe opacities, which could represent congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema, although supervening infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. Small pleural effusions may be present. Incidental note is made of bilateral glenohumeral degenerative disease.
