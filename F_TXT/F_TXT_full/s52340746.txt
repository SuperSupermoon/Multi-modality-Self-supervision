Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right PICC tip is in the upper-to-mid SVC. Low lung volumes are unchanged. Right lower lobe atelectasis and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm are stable. Opacities in the left base have increased, more so laterally, worrisome for an infectious process given the clinical symptoms. If any, there is a small left effusion.
