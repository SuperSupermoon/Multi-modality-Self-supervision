AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. No previous chest examination available for comparison. Patient is mildly rotated to the right accounting for some asymmetric presentation of the chest. No significant cardiac enlargement is present. The thoracic aorta appears moderately generally widened but no local contour abnormalities are seen. Pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there is no evidence of pleural effusion in the lateral pleural sinuses. No pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area. Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly unremarkable.
