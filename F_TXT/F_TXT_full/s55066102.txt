As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right pleural effusion has minimally increased. The resulting atelectasis at the left and right lung bases as well as the cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema persist. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a small pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No new parenchymal opacity. No pneumothorax.
