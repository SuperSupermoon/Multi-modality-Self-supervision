In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the cardiac silhouette again is at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels may beam slightly more prominent than on the previous study, consistent with mild increase in pulmonary vascular congestion. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Of incidental note is calcification in subclavian vessels bilaterally.
