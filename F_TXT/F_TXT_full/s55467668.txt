There is a new left central venous catheter with the tip terminating in the mid svc. Right sided port appears stable with the tip terminating at the superior cavo-atrial junction. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis; otherwise, the lungs are clear. There is slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature without overlying edema, suggesting fluid resuscitation. There is slight rightward tracheal deviation which could relate the left-sided goiter noted on CT scan.
