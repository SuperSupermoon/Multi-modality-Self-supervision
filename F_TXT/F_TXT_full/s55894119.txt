An endotracheal tube has been placed and appears slightly deviated to the right, however, the clinical team confirms an endotracheal location. The tip is located 2 cm above the carina. There is a non layering, large left pleural effusion. Left retrocardiac opacity is likely a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis. Given the diffuse parenchymal abnormality, evaluation of the left hilus and mediastinum is limited. The right lung is clear. No pneumothorax.
