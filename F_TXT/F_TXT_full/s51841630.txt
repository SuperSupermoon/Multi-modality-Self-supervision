A single frontal portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are increased compared to the prior study from ___. Consolidative opacities at both lung bases likely reflect compressive atelectasis and pleural effusions, although concomitant infection at either lung base is certainly possible. There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Background emphysematous changes are redemonstrated. The heart size is top normal. The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous, as before. There is no pneumothorax.
