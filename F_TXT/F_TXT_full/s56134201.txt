Tracheostomy tube, esophageal stent and PICC remain in place. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Widespread airspace opacities affecting the right lung to greater degree than the left are again demonstrated, and are concerning for widespread infection. Known abscess in right lower lobe is seen to better detail on recent CT. Pigtail pleural catheter is present in the lower right hemithorax, presumably within the abscess. Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.
