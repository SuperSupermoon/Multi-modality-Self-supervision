Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is unchanged. Right lower lobe opacity is likely atelectasis. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. Transvenous pacemaker leads are in standard position.
