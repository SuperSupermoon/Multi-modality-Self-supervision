Radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, terminating in the lower portion of the patient's neoesophagus with interval advancement of the tube compared to the prior recent radiograph. Otherwise, little interval change in the appearance of the chest except for increasing patchy opacities in the left mid and lower lung regions.
