Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm, and loops within the region of the stomach, with the tip not assessed. Low lung volumes are present with elevation right hemidiaphragm, of unknown chronicity. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Bibasilar airspace opacities are more pronounced in the right lung base, and likely reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. A VP shunt catheter is noted coursing along the right aspect of the neck, chest and upper abdomen. Extensive degenerative changes are noted in the left shoulder.
