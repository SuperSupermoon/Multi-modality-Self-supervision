A single portable supine radiograph of the chest was acquired. There is pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Consolidative left retrocardiac opacification is some combination of a new small left pleural effusion and atelectasis and/or pneumonia. There is no right pleural effusion. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are normal. Aortic calcifications are noted. There is no pneumothorax.
