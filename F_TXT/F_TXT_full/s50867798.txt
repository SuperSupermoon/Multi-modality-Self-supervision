Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. A right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen terminating in the low SVC. There are innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules as seen on the prior study and also better assessed on subsequent chest CT. Some of these nodules are cavitary, which was better assessed on CT. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
