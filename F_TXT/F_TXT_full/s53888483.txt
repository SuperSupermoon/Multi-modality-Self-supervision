The study was performed on ___ and was submitted for review by the radiologist on ___. Portable supine radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube is in place, terminating 5.9 cm above the carina. There is collapse of the right mid to lower lung with a large right pleural effusion, as seen previously on PET-CT. Additionally, there is patchy opacification in the left lung base, possibly due to infection or aspiration. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the left hemidiaphragm. Aortic arch calcifications are noted. The patient is rotated, somewhat limiting assessment, but there is no definite evidence of pneumothorax on this study.
