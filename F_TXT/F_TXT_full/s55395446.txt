Bilateral ground-glass opacities sparing the right lung base have significantly improved. It was probably secondary to asymmetric pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe opacities, mostly due to atelectasis, are unchanged. Lung volumes are low. Right hilar region convexity is more pronounced today, of indeterminate significance. It does not have the usual shape of lobar atelectasis, and without prior chest x-ray before the surgery, it is difficult to assess if it is chronic or acute. There are some radiolucencies in this density. The ET tube is in adequate position. There is no pneumothorax. Unusual line is seen in left upper mediastinum, could be due to the projection only.
