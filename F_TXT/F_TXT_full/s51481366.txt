There is stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and increased opacification of the right lung base, most compatible with atelectasis. There is plate-like atelectasis at the left costophrenic angle. The lungs are otherwise clear. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
