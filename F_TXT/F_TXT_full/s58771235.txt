AP chest compared to ___, 11:06 p.m.: Mild pulmonary edema has changed in distribution, but not in severity. Appearance of the right lower lobe is most consistent with dependent atelectasis and edema. Left lower lobe remains severely atelectatic. With the chin down, position of the ET tube, 2.5 cm from the carina is acceptable. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Some pleural effusion is presumed, but not substantial. Right PIC line can be traced as far as the low SVC where the tip is obscured by the upper enteric drainage tube passing into the stomach and out of view. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in their expected positions.
