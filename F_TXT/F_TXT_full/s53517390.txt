There is nearly complete opacification of the left hemi thorax as on the earlier study. The patient's head obscures observation of the apices limiting evaluation. There is stable patchy density and possible effusion in the right base. There is no definite CHF or pneumothorax, but evaluation pneumothorax is limited on this exam.
