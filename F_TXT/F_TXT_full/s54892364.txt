ET tube and NG tube have been removed. A tracheostomy is now present. A right-sided PICC line tip is not well delineated, but likely lies in the region of the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax is detected, with note made that the medial portion both lung apices are obscured by the mask surrounding the tracheostomy tube. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Vascular plethora, bibasilar effusions with underlying bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation is again noted, overall similar prior. The presence of associated pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded. Density seen in the upper abdomen to the left of midline may represent material may relate to the patient's splenic artery embolization.
