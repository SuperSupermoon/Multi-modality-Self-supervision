There has been slight interval worsening of mild to moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema. The layering left effusion with associated retrocardiac consolidation also appears slightly worse. A superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is likely a smaller layering right effusion. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
