1. Endotracheal tube, left subclavian central line, gastric tube and left basilar pigtail catheter remain in place. Status post median sternotomy with valve replacement. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation on the current examination. Persistent linear opacity at the right base likely represents patchy atelectasis. The right pleural effusion appears somewhat smaller. The pulmonary vascularity appears less well defined on the current examination which suggests superimposed mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is seen.
