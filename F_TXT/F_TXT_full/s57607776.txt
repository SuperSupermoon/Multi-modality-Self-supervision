Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of the right ventricular outflow tract. The double tube has been removed. There is substantial distension of the stomach that might potentially benefit from the NG tube insertion. What appears to be a E ureteral stent is partially imaged. Bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left are present. Vascular congestion is noted, borderline with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
