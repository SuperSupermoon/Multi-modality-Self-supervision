Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance in the postoperative setting. Worsening bibasilar retrocardiac opacities probably represent atelectasis, and bilateral pleural effusions present, moderate on the right and small on the left, with interval increase on the right side. No visible pneumothorax.
