Supine portable AP chest radiograph is obtained. The tip of the endotracheal tube resides approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. The NG tube is coiled in the left upper abdomen. Clips in the right upper quadrant noted. Lung volumes are low, though the lungs appear clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or supine evidence of signs of pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. The imaged osseous structures appear grossly intact.
