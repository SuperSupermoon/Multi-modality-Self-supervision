AP chest compared to ___ at 3:27 a.m. and chest CTA at 5:00 a.m. The volume of right hemothorax has increased, and there is greater opacification lateral to the right paratracheal region of the mediastinum. This could be additional hemothorax or pulmonary contusion. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has progressed. All these findings should be kept under close radiographic surveillance. Aside from mild atelectasis at the base, left lung is clear. There is no obvious pneumothorax. Rib fractures are better assessed on the intervening chest CTA.
