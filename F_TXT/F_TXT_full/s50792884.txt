AP chest compared to ___, ___:36 a.m.: Patient has been extubated and lung volumes are low but reasonably well maintained. Heterogeneous opacification in the left lung, particularly peripherally could be pneumonia or even pulmonary nodules. CT scanning would be helpful in clarification. There is also suggestion of left-sided pleural thickening, perhaps calcification. There is no appreciable layering pleural effusion. Right lung is grossly clear. The heart is normal size. Mediastinal fullness to the right of the lower trachea is probably vascular engorgement rather than a large mass since the trachea is not shifted away from that side.
