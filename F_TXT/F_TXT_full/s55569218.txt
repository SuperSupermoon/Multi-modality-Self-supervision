Findings do not support a diagnosis of ARDS in this admission. Previous severe atelectasis and edema have improved, though substantial atelectasis persists in the left lower lobe. Any paraspinal hematoma in that location would be obscured by the atelectasis. Indwelling left basal pleural drain unchanged in position. Left pleural effusion small if any. No pneumothorax. Mild right upper lobe atelectasis improved. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. No pneumothorax. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube loops in nondistended stomach.
