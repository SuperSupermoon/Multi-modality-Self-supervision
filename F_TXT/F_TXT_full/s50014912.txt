The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube lies below the thoracic inlet, approximately 5 cm above the carina; previously it closely approached the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its distal course not imaged. The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is a focal hazy opacification projecting over the left upper lung while the left lung base appears clear. Although a confounding factor is moderate rightward convex scoliosis, there is a suggestion of mild volume loss with leftward shift of mediastinal structures. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
