AP chest compared to ___: Substantial atelectasis, left lower lobe. Tiny left apical pneumothorax; pleural effusion small, if any. Subcutaneous emphysema on both sides of the chest wall, left greater than right. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube ends in the lower esophagus, would need to be advanced 15 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Right subclavian infusion port ends in the mid SVC. Right pleural tube is looped and redundant, before it ends to the left of the midline, impinging on the mediastinum. Dr. ___ and I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.
