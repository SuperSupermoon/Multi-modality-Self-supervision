Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Bilateral asymmetrical predominantly perihilar airspace opacities are again demonstrated, slightly worse on the left and slightly improved on the right. Moderate pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity are unchanged. No visible pneumothorax on this semi-upright radiograph.
