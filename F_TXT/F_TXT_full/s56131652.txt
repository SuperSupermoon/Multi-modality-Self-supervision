1. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which is in satisfactory position in this patient status post esophagectomy. Right chest tube remains in place. Left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. There are patchy opacities at both bases and blunting of the left costophrenic angle unchanged but possibly reflecting bibasilar atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
