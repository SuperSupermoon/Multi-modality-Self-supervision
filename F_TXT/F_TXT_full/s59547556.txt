There are low lung volumes and patient is rotated somewhat to the right. The aorta is tortuous/unfolded with slight increase in prominence of the ascending aorta which may be due to differences in patient position. There is minimal interstitial edema, possibly slightly improved since the prior study. No definite focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion although a trace right pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. No pneumothorax seen.
