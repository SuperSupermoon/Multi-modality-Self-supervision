A right-sided PICC is in-situ, this terminates in the mid SVC. A Dobhoff tube terminates in the stomach. Lung volumes are unchanged with slightly decreased volume on the right. No focal consolidation seen however. The right hilum appears prominent but this is similar when compared to multiple prior studies.
