As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. In the interval, the patient has received an inferior vena cava device as well as the Swan-Ganz catheter. The Swan-Ganz catheter is in correct position, the caval device projects with its tip over the right atrium. One of the two right internal jugular vein catheters has been removed. Overall, the known parenchymal opacities remain very widespread but lung volumes have slightly increased, with an increased transparency at the lung bases, likely reflecting improved ventilation. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
