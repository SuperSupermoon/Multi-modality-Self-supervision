AP chest compared to ___, 4:39 p.m.: The lungs show minimal edema. There is greater opacification at the right lung base than in the upper lung, which could be due to concurrent pneumonia. Heart is moderately enlarged and there is still moderate distention of mediastinal veins suggesting elevated central venous pressure. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable and comparable to the appearance on recent chest CT and central pulmonary arteries are enlarged enough to raise concern for a pulmonary arterial hypertension.
