Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. There is mild crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with slight prominence of the interstitium which is felt to most likely be related to lower lung volumes rather than representing an atypical infectious process or underlying interstitial abnormality. Clinical correlation, however, is recommended. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.
