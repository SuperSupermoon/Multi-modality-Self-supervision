There is new development of airspace opacification (volume loss suggests associated atelectasis) in the right middle as well as right lower lobe. The left lung is clear. No large effusions. Mild cephalization of pulmonary blood vessels. Small Bochdalek hernias see in the medial aspect of the left inferior posterior hemithorax.
