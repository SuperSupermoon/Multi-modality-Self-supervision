Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged. Aorta is tortuous. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more so on the right, likely reflect atelectasis though aspiration cannot be completely excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. There is no acute osseous abnormality.
