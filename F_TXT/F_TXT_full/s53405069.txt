Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. ET tube in standard placement. Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects over the main pulmonary artery. Midline and pleural drains in standard placements. Atrioventricular pacer leads unchanged in standard positions. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
