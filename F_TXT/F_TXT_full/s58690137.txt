A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left PICC terminating in the mid to low SVC and a right chest pigtail catheter. There has been interval removal of an enteric tube. Lung volumes are low, with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, here is mild cardiac enlargement. A right pleural effusion appears similar, moderate in volume. There is associated atelectasis, as well as atelectasis in the left base. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
