In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there are relatively low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, and substantial bilateral pleural effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis. Volume loss is again seen in the left lower lobe. The dialysis catheter extends to just above the esophagogastric junction. The right ventricular pacer lead again appears coiled height ___ in the region of the tricuspid valve with the tip projecting to the right ventricle.
