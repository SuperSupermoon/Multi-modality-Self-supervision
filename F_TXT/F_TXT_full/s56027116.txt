Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. Prominence of the right paratracheal stripe is again noted, and appears to be due to tortuous vessels as seen on the prior CT torso from ___. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized. Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are present.
