Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube extending to 2.2 cm above the carina. An enteric tube has tip in the stomach and side port below the GE junction. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly prominent but accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes. The lungs are clear without pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Several cholecystectomy clips are seen. There is retained contrast material in the proximal renal collecting systems.
