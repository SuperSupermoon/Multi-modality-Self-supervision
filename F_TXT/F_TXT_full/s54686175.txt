As compared to the previous image, the previously seen small right pleural effusion and the subsequent areas of bright atelectasis have almost completely resolved. A minimal atelectasis at the left lung base persists. The lung volumes continue to be relatively low and the heart is mildly enlarged, but there are currently no signs indicative of pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. Unchanged course of the left dialysis catheter.
