The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Mild cardiomegaly is demonstrated. The aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal contours otherwise are unremarkable. There is mild perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted with bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen though assessment of the lung apices is somewhat obscured due to the patient's chin projecting over this region. Deformity of the left proximal humerus is partially imaged and reflective of a remote healed fracture.
