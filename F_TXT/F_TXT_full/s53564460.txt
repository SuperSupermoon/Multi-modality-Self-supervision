Since the recent study from earlier the same date, a left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with decrease in size of left pleural effusion and improvement in adjacent atelectasis and or consolidation in the left mid and lower lung region. Probable persistent small left apical pneumothorax, difficult to assess due to extensive overlying subcutaneous emphysema, which is increased since the prior exam. Exam is otherwise unchanged.
