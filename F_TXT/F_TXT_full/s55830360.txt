The patient is status post previous median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. Stable cardiomegaly and persistent upper zone vascular redistribution, accompanied by minimal interstitial edema. Marked improvement in bibasilar retrocardiac opacities likely due to atelectasis. Small pleural effusions have improved since the recent radiograph.
