1. Interval improvement in overall inspiration. There is still persistent airspace consolidation with associated effusion in the right lung base which may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed infectious process should also be considered. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity favoring atelectasis with an associated small left effusion. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
