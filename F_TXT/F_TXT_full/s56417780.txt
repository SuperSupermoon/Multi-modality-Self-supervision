AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination obtained six and a half hours earlier during the same day. Status post sternotomy, marked cardiac enlargement and aortic valve replacement (metallic structures of porcine valve) unchanged. Pulmonary congestive pattern encountered earlier during the day has regressed slightly. Patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. Previously suspected small left apical pneumothorax cannot be identified with certainty now on portable film and a special high contrast copy. No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen.
