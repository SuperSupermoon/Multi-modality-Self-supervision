In comparison with the study of ___, post-operative changes are again seen in the left hemithorax with shift of the mediastinum to this side. Chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The right lung is essentially clear except for some residual atelectatic change at the base. The gas along the upper chest border on the left and subcutaneous tissues is decreasing. There appears to be some increase in the extensive opacification in the left hemithorax. This could reflect additional pleural fluid, though in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
