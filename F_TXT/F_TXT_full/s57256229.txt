There is no evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms. There are relatively low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal, however, likely exaggerated by AP technique and low lung volumes. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
