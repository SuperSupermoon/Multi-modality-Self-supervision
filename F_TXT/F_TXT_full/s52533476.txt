Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, worse on the right lung, has not changed appreciably over the past 3 days. Heart size is normal, smaller than on some prior images during this hospitalization. Heart failure is no longer contributory to the diffuse pulmonary abnormality, probably a combination of pneumonia and ARDS. Pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax. ET tube, and nasogastric tube, right-sided central venous catheter are in standard placements respectively
