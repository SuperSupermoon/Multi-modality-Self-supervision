As compared to the previous radiograph, the left-sided chest tubes are in unchanged position. The basal component of the known left pneumothorax has minimally increased. The apical component of the pneumothorax is unchanged. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. The patient is slightly rotated and therefore the trachea is slightly of the midline. However, short-term followup should be obtained to exclude tension. The atelectasis at the right lung base is minimally less dense, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. Unchanged position of the endotracheal tube and the left subclavian vein catheter.
