Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier. NG tube is not totally included in the film, appears to be coiled in the stomach and the tip projects in the stomach. Increased bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, are worrisome for large areas of aspiration and worsening previously seen pneumonia. There are probably increasing small effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged.
