The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates near the inlet of the diaphragm. A right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. There is again moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Surgical clips also project over the lower-to-mid mediastinum. Mediastinal widening is consistent with post-operative change. There is new confluent left basilar opacification suggesting atelectasis in the left lower lobe of substantial extent with a pleural effusion, probably small to moderate in size. A small subpulmonic right-sided pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. There is also subcutaneous emphysema, small in amount, along the right lateral chest wall, as well as a right-sided chest tube. The patient is status post incompletely characterized lower cervical fusion. Moderate degenerative change involves the right shoulder.
