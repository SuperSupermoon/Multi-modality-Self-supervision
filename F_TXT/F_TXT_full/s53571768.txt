There is a new endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3.3 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is too high with the sideport and tip within the esophagus. This could be advanced at least 20 cm for more optimal placement. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Diffuse airspace opacities are again seen and stable. There are no pneumothoraces.
