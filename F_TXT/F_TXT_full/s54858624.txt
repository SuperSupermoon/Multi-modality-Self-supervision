Interval development of partial collapse of right middle and right lower lobes suggesting mucous plugging within the bronchus intermedius. Accompanying moderate right pleural effusion has worsened since the prior study. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Left lung is grossly clear except for linear atelectasis at the left lung base. Questionable small left pleural effusion, but no visible pneumothorax.
