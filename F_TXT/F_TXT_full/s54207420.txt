It is noted that the right side of the chest wall has been excluded from this image. The physician at the patient's bedside did not desire an additional image to cover this portion of the anatomy. The patient has had interval intubation, with the tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 2 cm above the carina. The right can't left-sided pleural effusion seen previously are slightly more layering given the semi erect imaging technique. There is persistent retrocardiac dense opacity, as well as some increased opacity at the right lung base. The left basilar opacity likely represents a combination of consolidation and atelectasis, while the right-sided changes are more likely to be have a dominant component of atelectasis. No overt osseous abnormalities. Numerous cardiac monitoring leads are present.
