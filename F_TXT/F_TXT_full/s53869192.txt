CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. ET tube in satisfactory position. NG-type tube tip overlying fundus. NGT sideport in region of EG junction or slightly proximal to it. Background COPD noted. No focal infiltrate or consolidation, CHF or effusion identified. Note is made of two focal densities in the left mid-zone, in association with the posterolateral left ___ and 8th ribs, which likely represent superimposition of osseous and vascular shadows, but which are new compared with ___. These appear to be associated with non-acute rib fractures and are therefore not thought to represent pulmonary nodules. An additional rib fracture is noted in the left 9th rib laterally.
