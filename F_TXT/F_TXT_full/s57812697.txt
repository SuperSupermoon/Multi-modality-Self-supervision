Lung apices are excluded from this study centered at the level of the diaphragm. Nasogastric tube ends above the level of the gastroesophageal junction, and would need to be advanced at least 10 cm to enter the mid portion of the stomach. Combination of mild edema and pleural effusion in the right hemi thorax has improved. Opacification of the left hemi thorax due to previous pneumonectomy is inseparable from what might be a distended or displaced stomach. Right central infusion port and ET tube are in standard placements. There is probably no substantial pneumothorax.
