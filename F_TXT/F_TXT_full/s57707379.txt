Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, no significant changes are appreciated. Bilateral, diffuse, reticular opacities are unchanged in extent, distribution, and severity. No new parenchymal opacities. Heart size is top-normal. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are somewhat obscured by the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, but appear normal. Support devices and lines are unchanged in position.
