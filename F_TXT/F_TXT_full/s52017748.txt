Compared with ___ allowing for differences in technique, no definite change detected. Slight blurring may relate to motion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar, allowing for slight patient rotation. The transcatheter aortic valve replacement is again noted, similar in configuration. There is mild upper zone redistribution. Previously seen mild diffuse increased interstitial markings less apparent, likely due to motion-related blurring. No frank consolidation or gross effusion is identified. No pneumothorax detected. Previous studies have demonstrated a hiatal hernia. This likely accounts for the rounded area of lucency and density superimposed over the left cardiac silhouette on this study.
