AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in semi-upright position. The heart is not enlarged. Thoracic aorta mildly widened and elongated but without local contour abnormalities. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are seen and the lateral pleural sinuses are free. The diaphragms are relatively low positioned and somewhat flattened, a finding which suggests the possibility of COPD. Acute pulmonary infiltrates however cannot be identified and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___ apparently transferred from another Hospital. There are no significant interval changes. The previous examination also suggests some element of COPD.
