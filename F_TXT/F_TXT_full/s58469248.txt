AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Available for comparison is the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. The present portable chest examination has been obtained following performance of right thoracocentesis with placement of a chest tube from the right lower lateral chest wall (seventh intercostal space) and the tip of the tube projects in the apical lung field. A smaller catheter is overlying the right lower chest and coincides with a small remaining loculated pneumothorax which identifies the area where the previously existing extensive pleural effusion has been removed. The right lung demonstrates persistent appearance of the previously described apical mass but there is no evidence of new additional pulmonary abnormalities. Rather extensive right chest wall soft tissue emphysema is noted apparently related to the placement of the tube. The left hemithorax remains unchanged and is unremarkable. Heart size appears within normal limits and there is no evidence of pulmonary congestion.
