A right-sided PICC line is unchanged in position, terminating just beyond the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Evaluation of the lung parenchyma is somewhat limited by low lung volumes. However, new increased opacification at both lung bases may be due to subsegmental atelectasis, infection or aspiration. Pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema are new. There are new small bilateral pleural effusions.
