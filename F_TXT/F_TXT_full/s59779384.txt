In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits or of normal in size or mildly enlarged with mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, which could reflect either venous congestion or high E arterial flow state in this patient with sickle cell disease. There is minimal asymmetry of opacification at the right base which, in the appropriate clinical setting, could possibly represent a developing consolidation. A lateral view would be helpful for further evaluation.
