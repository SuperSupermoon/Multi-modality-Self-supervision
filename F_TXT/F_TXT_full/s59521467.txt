The feeding tube tip is in the body of the stomach. The heart size is within normal limits. There are again seen low lung volumes that have expanded slightly since the previous study. There are more confluent opacities in the perihilar regions and and right upper lobe. This is possibly all related to atelectasis; however, developing infiltrate from pneumonia is possible, particularly in the right upper lobe. No pneumothoraces are seen.
