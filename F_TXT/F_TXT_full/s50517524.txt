A right-sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC, unchanged. The tip of an enteric tube projects over the proximal stomach. Right sided pigtail catheter has been removed. Lung volumes are somewhat low which accentuates the prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular markings. The heart is moderately enlarged, but stable. Right basal opacity is similar in extent to the prior radiographs on ___ and is concerning for an area of focal pneumonia. There may be a small right effusion. Retrocardiac opacity suggests atelectasis.
