Left ventricular assist device projects over the left lower hemithorax/upper abdomen. Dual lead ICD with the right ventricular lead in the appropriate position, but the right atrial lead projects inferiorly (unchanged compared to prior imaging). Discontinuity of the superior most sternal wire but the sternal wires are well aligned. Right-sided PICC line in situ with the tip in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax. Stable transverse cardiomegaly. Presumed left lower lobe atelectasis. There is mild increase in congestion of the pulmonary vessels and the fluid seen in the right transverse fissure is unchanged, but there is no new overt pulmonary edema.
