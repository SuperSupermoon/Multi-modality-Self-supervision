Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated somewhat to the right. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Perihilar interstitial opacities may be due to interstitial edema with possible underlying chronic interstitial disease. More confluent left lower lung opacity could relate to prominent vascular structures or consolidation. Difficult to exclude trace bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in inspiration.
