AP chest compared to ___: Mild pulmonary edema has worsened. Moderate right pleural effusion, with posterior lateral and fissural components is larger. I would be surprised if the small drainage catheter were able to access fluid so widely distributed in the pleural space. No pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly stable.
