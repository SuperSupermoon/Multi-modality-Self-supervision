The ET tube terminates approximately 20 mm above the carina. There is a right-sided PIC line which terminates in the cavoatrial junction. There is an NG tube which extends below the diaphragm with the tip likely in the body of the stomach. The heart size is normal. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with mild bilateral pulmonary edema. Note is made of worsening of mild bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right. There is also increased consolidation of the right lung base, which could be secondary to aspiration. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
