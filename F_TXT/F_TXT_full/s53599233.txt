There is mild prominence of pulmonary vasculature without pulmonary edema, likely due to fluid resuscitation. Endotracheal tube is at 6 cm from the carina and further advancement by 1 cm recommended for optimal positioning. The lungs are clear with no evidence of a consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable given the changes in exam technique with stable right costophrenic blunting. No acute fractures are identified. An old left rib fracture is again noted. The previously visualized sternal fracture is not clearly delineated on this anterior projection only study.
