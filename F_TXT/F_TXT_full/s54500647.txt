Previous postoperative pulmonary edema has almost cleared, bibasilar atelectasis has not. Although the postoperative caliber of the upper mediastinal silhouette is comparable to the preoperative appearance, the width of the cardiac silhouette has decreased, due in part to evacuation of hemopericardium. No pneumothorax. Tip of the endotracheal tube is less than 3 cm from the carina, but the chin is flexed, and the tube is acceptable in position. Tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is in the region of the pulmonic valve. Midline drains in standard position. Right pleural drain still in place. No appreciable pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube ends in a nondistended stomach.
