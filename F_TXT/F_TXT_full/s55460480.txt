Compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are stable considering slightly lower lung volumes. A new opacity is present in the left lung base obscures the periphery of the left hemidiaphragm and adjacent costophrenic sulcus. Although potentially due to small pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis, developing infectious pneumonia should be considered in the setting of fever and neutropenia. Right lung is clear except for a new patchy opacity at the right lung base. Exam is otherwise remarkable for interval placement of right internal jugular catheter terminating in the lower superior vena cava, with no evidence of pneumothorax.
