Again seen is the markedly elevated left hemidiaphragm. There is near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax due to volume loss/ effusion. There is some mediastinal shift to the right. There is some mild vascular engorgement on the right but no overt pulmonary edema. Tracheostomy to, NG tube, and right PICC line are unchanged. Please note that the stomach is distended which is an unusual finding in a patient with an NG tube. Question if the NG tube is not connected to suction
