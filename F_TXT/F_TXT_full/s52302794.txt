AP chest compared to ___: Homogeneous opacification of the right lower hemithorax medially could be due to either consolidation in the right lower lobe or posteriorly layering pleural effusion, best evaluated with an upright chest radiograph when feasible. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal, and the costopleural surfaces are unremarkable. No evidence of pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement, and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Intraaortic balloon pump ends midway between the upper margin of the left main bronchus and the apex of the aortic knob, approximately 3.5 cm from the latter.
