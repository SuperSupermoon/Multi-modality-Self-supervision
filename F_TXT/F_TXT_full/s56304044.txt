As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of mild pulmonary edema. The patient is rotated. Moderate pleural effusions are seen bilaterally. Moderate subsequent atelectasis. The patient remains intubated, a right subclavian access line and a nasogastric tube are visualized. No new parenchymal opacities that would suggest pneumonia.
