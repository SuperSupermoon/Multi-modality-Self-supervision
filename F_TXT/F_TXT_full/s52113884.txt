No pneumothorax detected. Compared 1 day earlier, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is the right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and the 3 right-sided chest tubes. The mediastinum remains midline. Mild vascular plethora is noted in the left lung, with atelectasis at the left base. No left effusion.
