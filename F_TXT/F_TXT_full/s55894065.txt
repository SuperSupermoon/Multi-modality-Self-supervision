Right-sided chest tube is overall in similar position compared to the prior exam; however, there has been interval improvement of a moderate right-sided pleural effusion with opacification of the right lung base likely secondary to re-expansion edema. There has been interval increase in the atelectasis at the left lung base. There may be a tiny right apical pneumothorax. The remainder of the left lung is clear. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Again seen is a ventriculoperitoneal shunt coursing across the chest to the right of midline.
