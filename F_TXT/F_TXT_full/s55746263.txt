There has been recent placement of a pleural catheter in the lower right hemithorax, with associated decrease in size of a right pleural effusion. No visible pneumothorax on this semi-upright radiograph. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard position. Multifocal cavitary and non-cavitary areas of consolidation are again demonstrated, in keeping with history of septic emboli.
