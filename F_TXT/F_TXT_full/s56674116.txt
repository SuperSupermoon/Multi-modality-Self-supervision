1. Endotracheal tube is unchanged in position. Right-sided pacemaker is seen with two cardiac leads, one of which is discontinuous and likely not connected to the chest generator. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged status post median sternotomy. Skin ___ are seen overlying the superior mediastinum in this patient with known recent neck surgery. Improvement in aeration of the right lung base, but persistent vascular congestion likely reflects a component of resolving pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity at the left base may reflect patchy atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
