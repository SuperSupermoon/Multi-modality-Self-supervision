Left-sided AICD device is re- demonstrated with leads terminating the regions of the coronary sinus and right ventricle. Heart remains severely enlarged, perhaps minimally decreased in size from the prior study. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. There is continued mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved in the interval. Left basilar opacification likely reflects a combination of a small pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, not substantially changed from the prior. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
