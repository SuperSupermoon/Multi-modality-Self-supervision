The ICD generator is seen overlying the left chest wall with three leads attached, one in the expected location of the right atrium and two in the expected location of the right ventricle, one of which is new from prior exam. One of the leads has been disconnected from the generator, presumably the one being replaced. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present. There is stable mild cardiomegaly. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
