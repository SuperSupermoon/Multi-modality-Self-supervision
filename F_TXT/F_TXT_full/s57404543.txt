Moderate left pleural effusion unchanged. Left lower lobe poorly aerated, possibly relaxation atelectasis due to the effusion. Right lung is clear. Heart is normal size and hilar and mediastinal contours unremarkable. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement. Esophageal drainage tube would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. No feeding tube is seen.
