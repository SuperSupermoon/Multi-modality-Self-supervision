There is a small right pleural effusion. There is no left pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The lungs are clear without a consolidation or edema. Linear calcifications along the left mid lung zone and right base are most consistent with calcified pleural plaques. There is a minimally displaced lateral ninth rib fracture. The lower ribs are not included in the field of view.
