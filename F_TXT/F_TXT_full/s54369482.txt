AP chest compared to ___: In the interim, patient has had spinal stabilization. New intended left internal jugular line passes behind the left clavicle and surgical device, out of view. Tip probably does not enter the transverse portion of the left brachiocephalic vein. ET tube is in standard placement ending at the thoracic inlet. Lung volumes are very low, but left lung appears clear aside from mild basilar atelectasis. On the right, atelectasis is much more severe and there is probably lower lobe collapse, perhaps middle lobe collapse as well, and if they are accompanied by small right pleural effusion that would be unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is indeterminate but not substantially enlarged.
