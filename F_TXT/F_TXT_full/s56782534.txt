Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval increase in retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe volume loss and small left-sided pleural effusion. Right lung is unchanged. Stable cardiomegaly. Endotracheal tube is again somewhat obscured by the spinal fixation device, but appears to be in unchanged position. A chest tube is seen projecting over the left hemithorax. Nasogastric tube is seen with the tip terminating in the stomach.
