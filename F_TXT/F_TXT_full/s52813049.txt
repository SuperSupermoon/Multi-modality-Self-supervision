Lung volumes remain low. Patchy opacity at the right base and the left mid lung more likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low volumes, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. The heart remains enlarged. Aorta is calcified consistent with atherosclerosis. Prior median sternotomy. The patient's mandible obscures the apices.
