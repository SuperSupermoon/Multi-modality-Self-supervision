Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Multifocal heterogeneous lung opacities in the right upper lobes and both lower lobes are again demonstrated, with slight worsening at the bases. These findings may be due to multifocal pneumonia, probably on the basis of recurrent aspiration given similar but more severe findings in these regions on earlier chest x-ray of ___ and ___. Followup radiographs after completion of antibiotic therapy are suggested to document resolution. At that time, an 8 mm diameter round opacity in the periphery of the left upper hemi thorax may also be reassessed. This could potentially be external to the patient considering its changing location on recent sequential radiographs, but a pulmonary nodule is not excluded on the basis of this single portable exam.
