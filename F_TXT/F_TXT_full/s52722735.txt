The mid to lower lateral left hemithorax is not fully included on the image. Single supine portable view of the chest demonstrates nasogastric tube passing into the stomach and out of view. Endotracheal tube noted at the level of the clavicles, 9.9 cm above the carina. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Depression of the right hilum noted in conjunction with the right lower lung opacification is concerning for right lower lobe collapse. Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle is likely due to small pleural effusion. Faint asymmetry in opacification at the bilateral lung apices may reflect patient positioning or possibly layering effusion.
