The patient remains intubated. An orogastric tube passes into the stomach and crosses into the right lower quadrant. It probably terminates in the distal antrum. The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is a patchy retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms, somewhat improved, and veil-like opacity, potentially a small left-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
