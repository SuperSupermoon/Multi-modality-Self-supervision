A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. Low lung volumes exaggerate the heart size and interstitial markings. The lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart size is top normal. Mediastinal contours are normal. Cholecystectomy clips are visible in the right upper quadrant. There is no displaced rib fracture.
