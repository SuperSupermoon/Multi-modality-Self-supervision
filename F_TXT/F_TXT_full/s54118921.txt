In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes with central catheter in place. There is persistent and possibly slightly increased opacification at the left base, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia could not be excluded. No evidence of acute pulmonary edema.
