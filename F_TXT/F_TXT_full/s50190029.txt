Cardiac silhouette size is mild to moderately enlarged, decreased from the previous study. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is present, similar compared to the previous exam. There may be small bilateral pleural effusions, though the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No large pneumothorax is detected.
