In comparison with the outside study of this date, there is opacification at the right base which is most consistent with pleural fluid and substantial collapse of the right lower lobe. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would certainly have to be considered. There is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No definite pneumonia is seen, though in the absence of a lateral view it is impossible to assess the retrocardiac region. Tracheostomy tube is in place. Left subclavian PICC line extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Multiple old healed rib fractures is seen on the left with at least 1 previous healed fracture on the right.
