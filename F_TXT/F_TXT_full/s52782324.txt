AP chest compared to ___: Heterogeneous opacification in the left mid and lower lung is probably pneumonia, unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema in the right lung has worsened and small foci of infection may be present as well. Large ring shadow in the axillary right upper lobe is longstanding, perhaps saccular bronchiectasis. Aortic endograft unchanged in position traversing the aortic arch. ET tube and left PIC line, upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements. A right supraclavicular central venous line ends in the upper right atrium. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist. No pneumothorax.
