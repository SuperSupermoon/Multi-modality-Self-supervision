Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The feeding tube and the NG tube can be seen, with NG tube passing below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach, but the feeding tube tip being at the gastroesophageal junction that should be further advanced. Two central venous lines are present, both inserted through the internal jugular vein unremarkable. Widespread opacities predominantly affecting lower lobes are noted and grossly unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
