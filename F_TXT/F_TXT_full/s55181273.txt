Dual lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. Probable background hyperinflation. There is mild cardiomegaly, similar to the prior study. As before, there is slight prominence of the right left pulmonary arteries, which could reflect an element of pulmonary hypertension. The aorta is calcified. On today's exam, there is upper zone redistribution and mild increased interstitial markings. More confluent opacities are seen in the right upper zone, right and left lung bases. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation, similar to ___ , but slightly more pronounced. Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles is compatible with small effusions. Possible mild bronchiectasis at the left lung base and in the right suprahilar region. No pneumothorax detected.
