No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is detected. Compared to the prior film, the right paratracheal opacity is more readily visible. I suspect this is due to differences in technique, but slight interval enlargement cannot be entirely excluded. The trachea in this area does not appear narrowed. Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette, including the hilar adenopathy, is unchanged. No CHF or focal consolidation. Mild patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is slightly improved. Platelike atelectasis in the right mid zone is new.
