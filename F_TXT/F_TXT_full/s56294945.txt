The endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina. The enteric tube passes below the diaphragm mass and continues out of view. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Increased right upper lobe opacity may be due to items outside of the patient. Left lower lobe volume loss and small effusion is unchanged. Notably, the left internal jugular catheter, previously described as possibly intra-arterial in course, has not changed in position.
