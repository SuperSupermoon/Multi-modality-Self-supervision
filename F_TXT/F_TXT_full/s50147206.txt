ETT tip projects approximately 4 cm from the carina. The right internal jugular venous catheter tip projects over the expected region of the SVC-RA junction. An enteric tube traverses the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant and its tip is beyond the scope of the time. Lung volumes remain low. Bilateral airspace opacities, more conspicuous on the left compared to the right may reflect asymmetric edema or concurrent action. Small bilateral layering pleural effusions are minimally changed. Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged bronchovascular crowding and pulmonary vascular congestion.
