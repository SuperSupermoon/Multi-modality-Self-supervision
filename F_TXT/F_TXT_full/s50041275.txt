A left-sided chest tube is present, unchanged. Again, multifocal pulmonary opacities are seen predominantly in the left upper-to-mid lung zones, and appearing relatively unchanged. There may be slight improvement of the overall appearance of edema within the right hemithorax. A small left-sided pleural effusion is present, unchanged. A trace right-sided pleural effusion is also likely present. No new pneumothorax. Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulders. A notable scoliosis of the lumbar spine is seen, convex to the right.
