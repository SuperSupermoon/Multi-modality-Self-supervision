In comparison with the study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. There is a small amount of opacification in the right cardiophrenic angle, most likely representing only normal vessels and minimal atelectasis. No definite acute focal pneumonia.
