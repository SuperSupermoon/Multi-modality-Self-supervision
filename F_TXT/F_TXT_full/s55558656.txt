There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating at the cavoatrial junction, without evidence of pneumothorax. Lung volumes remain low and are without focal consolidation. Previously seen right midline is no longer seen and may have been removed in the interval. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Right upper quadrant biliary stents are noted.
