AP chest compared to ___: Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema continues to progress with bibasilar predominance. Heart is top normal size. Mediastinal veins are still dilated but improved since ___. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. Displacement of the gastric bubble presumably reflects splenomegaly. Right jugular line ends 5 cm below the level of the carina, would need to be withdrawn 15 mm to be sure it is in the low SVC and not in the upper right atrium. No pneumothorax.
