As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased. There is a minimal atelectasis at the left lung bases, potentially accompanied by a minimal pleural effusion, reflected by blunting of the left costophrenic sinus. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. The nasogastric tube is in constant position.
