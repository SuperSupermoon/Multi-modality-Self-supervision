Pneumoperitoneum is present, and has been more fully evaluated on subsequent abdominal CT ___. Endotracheal tube has been exchanged for a tracheostomy tube, and a nasogastric tube is been removed. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by apparent worsening asymmetrically distributed lung opacities predominantly involving the perihilar regions in left upper lobe. These findings could be due to multifocal infection with or without coexisting pulmonary edema.
