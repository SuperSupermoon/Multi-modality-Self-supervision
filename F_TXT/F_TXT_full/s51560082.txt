The endotracheal tube remains in good position. Nasogastric tube extends to the mid body of the stomach, before coiling upon itself so that the tip lies close to the esophagogastric junction and pointing upwards. No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. Multiple punctate opacifications are seen in the right mid to upper abdomen. However, these are not appreciated on a CT examination on the following day and could well be artifactual.
