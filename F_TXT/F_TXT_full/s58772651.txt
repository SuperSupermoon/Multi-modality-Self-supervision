AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Lung volumes are lower on the current study which serves to exaggerate pulmonary vascular caliber and the abnormal background interstitium of the lungs present on prior studies. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinal veins may be dilated. I would recommend repeat conventional radiographs as soon as feasible to see if the vascular abnormalities and interstitial edema are genuine, and to evaluate the left lung apex, which shows greater opacity medially than the right. All of these findings could be artifacts of low lung volume.
