Lung volumes are low. Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. Diffuse hazy ill-defined opacities are noted in the lungs, more extensive than compared to the previous exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist, not substantially changed in the interval. Bibasilar atelectasis remains similar compared to the prior exam. Assessment for pneumothorax is limited on this exam due to the patient's chin and neck soft tissues obscuring the lung apices, though no large pneumothorax is detected.
