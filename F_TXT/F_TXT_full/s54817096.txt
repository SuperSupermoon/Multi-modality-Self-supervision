Low lung volumes persist and there are patchy bibasilar opacities with likely associated small layering effusions. Findings would favor compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should be considered in the correct clinical setting. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the low lung volumes.
