As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, which could potentially be caused by decreased ventilatory pressures. As a consequence, the bilateral parenchymal opacities appear slightly denser than on the previous image. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No new parenchymal opacities have newly occurred. No pleural effusions are seen. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
