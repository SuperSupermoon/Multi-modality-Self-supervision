The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected. There is faint increased opacity in the medial left lung apex compared to the right. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Note is made of a healed but non-united fracture of the distal end of the right clavicle, which is unchanged from prior examinations. There is no evidence of bridging callus across the fracture line. Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
