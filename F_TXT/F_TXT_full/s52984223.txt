Right pleural drain, ET and NG tubes are unchanged and in standard position. Left pleural drain has been removed. Since prior chest x-ray there has been interval reduction of lung volume with increased opacity likely due to pulmonary edema. Part of the opacity in the right lung is residual lung parenchymal contusion. There is no left pleural effusion. Right pleural effusion is small. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is apparently enlarged due to reduced lung volume.
