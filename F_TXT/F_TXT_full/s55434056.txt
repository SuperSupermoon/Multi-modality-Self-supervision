There is stable cardiomegaly. The aorta is tortuous and there is calcification of the aortic knob. There is prominence of the right hilus, similar in appearance to the prior examination in ___. There is a small right pleural effusion and likely small left pleural effusion. A 6cm wide elliptical opacity in the left mid lung is better evaluated by the CTA performed subsequently but available at the time of this review.
