Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.9 cm from the carina. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged but accentuated as result of low lung volumes. Mediastinal widening is likely due to supine AP technique and low lung volumes. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky and linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. More focal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region could reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
