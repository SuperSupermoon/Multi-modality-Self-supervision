AP chest compared to preoperative chest radiograph, ___: Tip of the ET tube is obscured by spinal hardware, but probably in standard position, more than 3 cm above the carina. Right jugular line ends in the mid-to-low SVC. Leftward shift of the mediastinum is new, probably a function of substantial left lower lobe atelectasis and new small right pleural effusion. There is also new consolidation at the base of the right lung, another region of atelectasis is presumed. Both lower lungs need to be followed closely to exclude developing pneumonia. The upper lungs are clear and there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or other evidence of cardiac decompensation. Distention of the intestinal tract seen in the upper abdomen is comparable to the preoperative appearance.
