Compared with the prior study, minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles remains visible, but is grossly unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged allowing for technical differences. Sternotomy wires and mitral valve again noted. The left pulmonary artery appears prominent ,with a tapered appearance, which could reflect pulmonary hypertension. The right pulmonary artery is likely obscured due to overlying structures. There is borderline upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Again seen is retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and there subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base. Left convex scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine, with a rotary component, is again noted.
