Again seen is extensive emphysema with prominent bullous changes particularly at the bases. However, there is increased lucency at the left base with slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm as well as increasing infrahilar opacity. Findings therefore raise the possibility of a loculated pneumothorax. Followup imaging is recommended. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. A left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction and a nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. No pulmonary edema.
