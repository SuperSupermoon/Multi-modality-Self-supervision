In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, mild pulmonary vascular congestion has increased. No pulmonary edema. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. Increased, now moderate right pleural effusion. Right pleural pigtail catheter appears unchanged in position. There may be bibasilar atelectasis, but no evidence to suggest pneumonia. The right IJ sheath terminates at the origin of the SVC, a right PICC terminates in the lower SVC, and a single pacemaker lead is unchanged in position and probably terminates in the right ventricle.
