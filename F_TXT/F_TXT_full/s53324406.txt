Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is challenging due to the patient's rotation. However, it is felt the heart remains enlarged, most likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Overall, there are increasing perihilar opacities and coarsening of the interstitium suggestive of worsening pulmonary and interstitial edema. More focal patchy opacities at both lung bases may be related to the pulmonary edema, although atelectasis or pneumonia should also be considered. The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. No pneumothorax appreciated.
