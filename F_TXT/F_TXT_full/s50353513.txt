AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding studies obtained 2 and 6 hours earlier. Marked cardiac enlargement as before. Position of right-sided chest tube as well as smaller draining catheter unchanged. Unaltered position of previously described left-sided PICC line terminating in lower SVC and probably approaching right atrium. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. As before, markedly congested vascular pattern in lungs and evidence of bilateral pleural effusion. The congestive vascular pattern persists and may even have increased further. Size quantitation of this process on single chest view has limitations.
