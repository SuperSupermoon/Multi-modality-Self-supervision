The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. An ET tube terminates 4.5 cm above the carina. An NG tube terminates with its tip at the gastroesophageal junction. This should be advanced by at least 8 cm for optimal position.
