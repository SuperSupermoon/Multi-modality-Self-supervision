The patient was in moderate pulmonary edema ___. Edema is mild today, but severe pulmonary vascular engorgement persists, severe widening of the mediastinum due to central adenopathy makes it difficult to assess mediastinal venous caliber. There may be new consolidation or mass at the right lung base medially. Severe cardiomegaly is partially obscured by abnormality in the lingula which I cannot characterize on the single frontal view. There is no pneumothorax. Some pleural effusion is presumed, but not large.
