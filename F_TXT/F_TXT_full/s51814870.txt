Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.0 cm from the carina. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is slightly tortuous. There is mild perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacities in both lung bases as well as in the left upper lobe could reflect coexisting infection or aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. There are no displaced fractures.
