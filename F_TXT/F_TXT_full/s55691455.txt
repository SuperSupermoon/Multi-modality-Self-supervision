Nasogastric tube is coiled within the decompressed stomach, but bowel remains distended. No free intraperitoneal air. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC, unchanged. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding with persistent left hemidiaphragmatic elevation. Bibasilar atelectasis persists. Left pleural effusion is minimal, if any. No new opacity and no pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
