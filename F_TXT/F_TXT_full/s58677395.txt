AP portable single view chest x-ray shows improved bibasilar opacities, probably due to atelectasis. Bibasilar pleural effusion is small, larger to the left. Heart size is enlarged but stable since prior chest x-ray in patient who has had recent sternotomy for CABG. A tiny left apical pneumothorax is present.
