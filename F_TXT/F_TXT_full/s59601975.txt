There is widespread opacification of the right lower hemithorax including a suspected large pleural effusion on the right with an expansile appearance. There may be a corresponding consolidation or extensive atelectasis involving the right lower lobe and possibly parts of the right middle and upper lobe. The lenticular shape of right mid lung opacity could potentially be seen with a loculated pleural effusion, but a mass could also be considered. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. The left costophrenic sulcus is excluded, but there is no evidence of abnormality in the left hemithorax. Mild mass effect with leftward shift of midline structures is noted. There is no pneumothorax. No bone destruction is appreciated.
