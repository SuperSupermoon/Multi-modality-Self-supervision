A drain is present overlying the upper abdomen, with the distal portion overlying the left heart. The configuration is similar to the prior film. Allowing for differences in positioning, no definite change in a cardiomediastinal silhouette. Some hazy density adjacent to the right paratracheal and suprahilar regions does appear more pronounced. However, the appearance is in keeping with findings on the ___ radiograph. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
