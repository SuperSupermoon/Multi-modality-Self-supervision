Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained. The NG tube and right IJ has been removed. A right PICC line terminates in the low SVC. The left pleural effusion is slightly improved. Bibasilar opacities are likely secondary to layering pleural effusions and atelectasis, though pneumonia is certainly possible. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
