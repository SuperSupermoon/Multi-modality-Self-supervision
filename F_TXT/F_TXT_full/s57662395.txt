AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The AP single chest view demonstrates cardiac enlargement of similar magnitude as observed on the previous study. Cardiac configuration and appearance of thoracic aorta unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is still congested, but has undergone significant improvement of the previously detectable perivascular haze in the pulmonary vasculature. Also, the previously described mild blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses has decreased and almost disappeared completely. There is no evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates of pneumonic appearance. No pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area.
