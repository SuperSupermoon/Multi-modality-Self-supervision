Lung volumes are low, which may be secondary to positioning, slightly apical lordotic angle, and inadequate inspiration. Bilateral mild to moderate interstitial edema is probably overall unchanged from the prior exam. Stable enlarged heart size. No pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacity is probably from atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. Increased opacity in the right upper lung is probably from atelectasis. Stable appearance of the left pectoral three-lead cardiac pacemaker device is again noted.
