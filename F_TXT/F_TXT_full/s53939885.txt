AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the frontal view of the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination dated ___. The previously existing superior mediastinal mass resulting in marked right-sided deviation and compression of the trachea has been reduced significantly. Minor mediastinal deviation towards the right persists but the lumen of the trachea has improved. Postoperative elevation of diaphragms and thereto related crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature is noted, but no new parenchymal infiltrates are seen and there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.
