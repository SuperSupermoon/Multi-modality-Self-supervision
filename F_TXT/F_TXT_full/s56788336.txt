There are bibasilar pigtail catheters. The previously described left hydropneumothorax is not well seen, likely due to technique. There is a left-sided central line with the distal lead tip in the distal right atrium, unchanged from prior. Heart size is enlarged but stable. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion is seen. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. Overall, these findings appear relatively stable.
