As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient continues to be intubated and the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. Lung volumes are low but the lungs are clear from consolidations or other parenchymal changes, except for a somewhat expected small retrocardiac atelectasis. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema.
