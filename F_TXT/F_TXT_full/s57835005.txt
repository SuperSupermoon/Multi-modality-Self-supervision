1. Left subclavian central line and tracheostomy tube are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Lung volumes remain slightly diminished with slightly smaller layering bilateral effusions. Patchy retrocardiac opacity is again seen, suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. Right posterior lateral fifth through seventh rib fractures are again identified. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
