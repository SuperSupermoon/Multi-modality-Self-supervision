As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. Course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the middle to distal parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. Sternal wires are in unchanged correct alignment. Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. Presence of minimal bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded. The left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged.
