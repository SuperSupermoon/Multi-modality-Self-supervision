In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and there is little if any vascular congestion. Left hemidiaphragmatic contour is more sharply seen, though there is still blunting the costophrenic angle suggesting pleural fluid. The ill-defined nodular opacification in the right mid zone is again worrisome for malignancy. Chest CT is strongly recommended.
