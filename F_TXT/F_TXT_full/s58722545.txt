There has been some partial interval re-expansion of the left lung with some aerated lung seen laterally and superiorly. However there still large areas of consolidation in the left upper and lower lobes. Air bronchograms are visualized. There is small amount of decrease in the mediastinal shift again compatible with some interval re-expansion of the left lung the ET tube, NG tube and right-sided PICC line are unchanged. There is a new left-sided pigtail catheter projecting over the left lower lung There continues to be volume loss in the right lower lobe. There is new/ increased pulmonary vascular redistribution on the right suggesting increased pulmonary edema
