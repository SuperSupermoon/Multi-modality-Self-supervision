Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Assessment of the lung apices is obscured by the patient's chin and neck soft tissues projecting over these areas. There is minimal atelectasis at the lung bases. Degenerative changes are re- demonstrated in the thoracic spine. Small amount of free air is seen underlying the central tendon of the diaphragm.
