New endotracheal tube ends 3.3 cm from the carina. The left-sided PICC line now ends within the right subclavian vein. A left-sided midline drain is in place. Persistent opacification of the left hemithorax is essentially unchanged, with scattered air bronchograms in the left upper lobe. Cross-sectional imaging could further delineate the relative contributions of consolidation, collapse, and pleural effusion, though collapse is likely the dominant process causing the leftward mediastinal shift. Right-sided mild pulmonary vascular congestion has increased slightly. Enteric tube passes below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view within a decompressed stomach.
