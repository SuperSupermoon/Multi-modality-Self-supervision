Since the recent radiograph of a few hours earlier, there has been interval improved aeration of the lungs, particularly in the left upper and left lower lobes. Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung show a lesser degree of improvement, and may be due to multifocal contusion or aspiration in the setting of recent trauma. Widening of mediastinum has been more fully assessed on recent CT from two hours earlier, which demonstrated an acute aortic injury. Left rib fractures are also more fully evaluated on that study.
