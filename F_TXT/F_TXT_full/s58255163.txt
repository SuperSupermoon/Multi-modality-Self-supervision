As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the distal parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The other monitoring and support devices are unchanged, including the endotracheal tube, with its tip now approximately 2 cm above the carina.
