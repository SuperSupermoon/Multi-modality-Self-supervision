In comparison with study of earlier in this date, the endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 3.8 cm above the carina. Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There is a new area of thick linear opacification in the left mid zone, suggestive of atelectasis. There is also some increased opacification in the area adjacent to the aortic knob, which could be a focus of atelectasis or, in the appropriate clinical setting, aspiration. The right lung is clear.
