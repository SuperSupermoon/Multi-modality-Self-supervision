The heart is mildly enlarged, and allowing for differences in technique, likely is slightly increased compared to the prior study. The aorta remains tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. The lungs are hyperinflated. Emphysematous change is redemonstrated. Consolidative opacity in the left lower lobe is concerning for pneumonia. Right lung is grossly clear. There is likely a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
