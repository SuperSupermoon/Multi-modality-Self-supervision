AP chest compared to ___: Hazy opacification on both sides of the chest is due in part to pleural effusions layering posteriorly in the supine patient. This obscures what could be mild interstitial edema. Cardiac size is exaggerated by position as well, at least mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax. ET tube, right internal jugular line, and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. If there is a peripheral catheter in the left upper extremity, it ends outside the chest in the axilla. Clinical correlation advised. Dr. ___ has been paged at 9:20 a.m. and we discussed the findings by telephone at 9:22 a.m.
