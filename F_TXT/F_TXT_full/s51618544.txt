In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at the left base in the retrocardiac region with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm and blunting the costophrenic angle. This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude on this single frontal view. Opacification at the right base could reflect at atelectasis or even some developing consolidation, though much of it could be a manifestation of overlying lower portion of the scapula.
