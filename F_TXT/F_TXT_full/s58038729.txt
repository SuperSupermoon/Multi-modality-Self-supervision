AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the interval, the ETT has been removed and is substituted by the placement of a tracheostomy cannula. The latter terminates in the trachea level just at the lower border of the clavicles. The position is appropriate. There is no pneumothorax. In comparison with the previous study. The earlier identified left internal jugular approach the line terminates overlying the thoracic aorta at the level of the carina but remains to the left of the midline. Status post sternotomy as before and evidence of aortic as well as mitral valve replacement is present. Diffuse haze over the lung fields consistent with layering pleural effusions in the posterior compartments of the pleural spaces. This finding existed already earlier. No pneumothorax has developed.
