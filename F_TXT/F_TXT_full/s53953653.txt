Cardiac mediastinal contours are stable in this patient status post right upper lobectomy. No pneumothorax is seen. Lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions or pulmonary edema. There is some flattening of the right hemidiaphragm which may be postoperative given the volume loss in the right hemithorax.
