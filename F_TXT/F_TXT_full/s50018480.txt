When compared to most recent radiograph dated ___, there is improved aeration of the left lung. However, persistent opacification and leftward mediastinal shift in addition to right lung hyperexpansion is consistent with left lung collapse. There is increased opacity of the right lower lobe with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. While this may reflect atelectasis, infection cannot be excluded. There is likely a small left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Redemonstration of anteriorly dislocated right shoulder as well as third and second right rib fractures, present previously.
