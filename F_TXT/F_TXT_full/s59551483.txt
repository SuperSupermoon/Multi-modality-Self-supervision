The study was made available for my interpretation, today, ___ at 2:45 p.m. A right-sided PICC is seen terminating in the distal SVC/cavo-atrial junction. The left costophrenic angle likely relates to small left pleural effusion. The right lung is clear. No right pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. A drain is seen extending into the left upper quadrant. No evidence of free air seen beneath the hemidiaphragm.
