The previously documented left middle zone and left basilar opacities demonstrate interval improvement. These findings likely represent improving pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis. Right lower lobe atelectasis is essentially unchanged. A chest tube is seen within the right hemithorax with no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen, again unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Perineoesophageal opacity remains unchanged. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position terminating within the right atrium.
