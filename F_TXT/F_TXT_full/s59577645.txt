In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial decrease in the pulmonary opacifications. The left hemidiaphragm is sharply seen with much less retrocardiac opacification. Central prominence in the hilar region also has decreased with probable residual mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. No evidence of acute focal consolidation.
