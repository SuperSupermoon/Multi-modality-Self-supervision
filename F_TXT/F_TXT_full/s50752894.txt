Large right hydropneumothorax is again demonstrated with a large pleural effusion component, perhaps minimally increased in size from the prior study, and an unchanged small right apical pneumothorax component. Right basilar opacification likely reflects compressive atelectasis. Mild shift of midline structures towards the left appears to be new. Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with single lead terminating in the region of the right ventricle. Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of a large right pleural effusion, but appears mildly enlarged. The aorta is slightly unfolded. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. There is minimal atelectasis in the left lung base. No displaced fractures are noted.
