Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 5.4 cm above the carina. The right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC. The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC as well. Multifocal opacities appear to be improved, in particular in the right upper lobe, and most likely consistent with decrease in the pulmonary edema component. The remaining opacities might potentially reflect the extent of ARDS.
