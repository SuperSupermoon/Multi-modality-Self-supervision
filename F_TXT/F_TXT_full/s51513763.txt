1. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. There continues to be a layering left effusion with associated airspace opacity most likely representing compressive atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is likely a smaller right effusion with some associated atelectasis. The patient's mandible obscures the apices. No pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient's rotation and positioning.
