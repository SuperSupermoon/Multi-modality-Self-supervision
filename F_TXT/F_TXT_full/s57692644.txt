The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged allowing for differences in technique. Streaky right basilar opacity suggests scarring. A vague patchy density projects over the left mid to lower lung, probably in the lingula, but not well characterized. There is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An old healed right posterolateral sixth rib fracture is unchanged.
