Lung volumes are decreased when compared to the prior study. The patient is intubated, the tip of the ended tracheal tube is 2 cm above the level of the carina. A nasoenteric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm but the tip is not visualized. A dual lumen Port-A-Cath terminates in the distal SVC. There is left lower lobe atelectasis. Probable right middle lobe atelectasis also. No pneumothorax. No consolidation or pleural effusion seen.
