Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular markings. There is discoid atelectasis of the bilateral upper lungs. Opacities in the retrocardiac region also likely represent atelectasis. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The heart is at least top normal in size. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely secondary to a combination of vascular congestion and adjacent atelectasis, with an acute mediastinal process felt less likely in the absence of any chest pain. There may be a small amount of pleural fluid on the left. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Repeat with better respiratory effort
