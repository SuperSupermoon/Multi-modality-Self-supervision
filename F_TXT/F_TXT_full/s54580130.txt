An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 4.5 cm from the carina. One enteric tube is present with the tip in the stomach. A second enteric tube is present with the tip out of the field of view, though likely in the postpyloric position. A left internal jugular central venous catheter is present with the tip in the low SVC. Multiple surgical drains overlie the upper abdomen. These are unchanged from the prior exam. Since the prior exam, the bibasilar opacities have improved, suggesting improved atelectasis. There is no new focal airspace consolidation or pulmonary edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, grossly stable from prior exam. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
