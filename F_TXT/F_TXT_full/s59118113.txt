Lung volumes are decreased compared to the previous examination. Heart size appears mildly enlarged, slightly increased from prior, likely related to the decreased lung volumes. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears new in the interval. More focal patchy opacity is seen within the medial right lung base, which could reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities are present.
