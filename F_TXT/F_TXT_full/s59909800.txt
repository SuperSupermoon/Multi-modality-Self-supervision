A right pleural effusion is moderate with locules of gas projecting over the right lateral hemithorax which may be in the pleural space as seen on prior chest CT and or areas of parenchymal abscess. No definite left pleural effusion. Bilateral lower lobe parenchymal opacities are significantly worse from the prior exam. Cardiologic silhouette cannot be assessed. Aortic knob calcifications are mild. Biliary stents are incompletely imaged.
