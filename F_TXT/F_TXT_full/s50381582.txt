Since the prior radiograph performed earlier in the same hour, there has been interval placement of a right sided pigtail catheter with resulting re-expansion of the right lung. No evidence of residual pneumothorax. There may be a small pleural effusion on the right. No substantial left pleural effusion. Diffuse bilateral reticular opacities remain evident, more prominent on the left, which could be seen in the setting of chronic lung disease.
