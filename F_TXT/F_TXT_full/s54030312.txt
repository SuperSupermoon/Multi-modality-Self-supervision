AP chest radiograph. As compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier, there is minimal additional increase in the basal component of pneumothorax, but slight interval decrease in the apical component, that might reflect redistribution of the air. Subcutaneous air appears to be unchanged. The pigtail catheter is unchanged.
