The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable. The right PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction in the left jugular catheter terminates at the right atrium. When compared to the most recent study there is apparent opacification of the lower left lung that likely represents superimposed soft tissue. There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. There is a small bilateral lucencies underneath the diaphragm that is consistent with intraperitoneal air and is compatible with recent gastrostomy tube placement.
