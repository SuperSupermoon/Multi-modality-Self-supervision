As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.8 cm above the carina. The patient has a venous introduction sheath in the right internal jugular vein and a right PICC line. Lung volumes have slightly decreased. There are bilateral pleural effusions and areas of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema as well as non-characteristic opacities in the retrocardiac lung areas, likely reflecting atelectasis. In addition, the left upper lobe is relatively dense, so that the presence of a pneumonia in this area cannot be excluded. Close radiographic followups are required.
