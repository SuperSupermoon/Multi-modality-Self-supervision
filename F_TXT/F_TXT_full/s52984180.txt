In comparison with the study of ___, there are somewhat better lung volumes. Again there is retrocardiac opacification consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and some pleural fluid. Dense streak of atelectasis is again seen in the left mid to lower lung zone. Left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Mild layering effusion is again seen on the right. Continued dilatation of bowel loops in the visualized portion of the upper abdomen.
