AP image of the chest. The chest tube is seen in the right mid chest. The lungs are well expanded. There is more vascular congestion and pulmonary edema than on prior exam, consistent with the patient being in early heart failure. Opacity at the right lung base likely represents atelectasis. There has been interval increase in the right pneumothorax since most recent exam, however this pneumothorax is still much smaller than that seen on the exam prior to the most recent exam. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
