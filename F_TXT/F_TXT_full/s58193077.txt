AP portable upright view of the chest. The heart appears mildly enlarged. There are linear densities projecting over the lower lungs bilaterally which appear most compatible with atelectasis. There is no convincing evidence for pneumonia, edema, effusion or pneumothorax. The mediastinal contour appears normal. The imaged bony structures are intact.
