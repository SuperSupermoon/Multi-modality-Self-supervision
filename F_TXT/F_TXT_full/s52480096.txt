Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are again noted, which slightly limit assessment of the underlying pulmonary parenchyma. There are minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases possibly reflective of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size appearing top normal. No pulmonary vascular congestion is present. The aorta remains tortuous at tortuous. No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
