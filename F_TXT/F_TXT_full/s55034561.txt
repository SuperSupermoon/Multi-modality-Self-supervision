There is low lung volumes bilaterally with areas of linear opacification inferiorly, most likely representing bibasilar atelectasis; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, there could be superimposed aspiration. Otherwise, there are no other areas of focal consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and within normal limits. The pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
