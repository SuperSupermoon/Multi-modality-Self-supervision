An endotracheal tube remains in the upper airway. The enteric catheter projects over the stomach. Since yesterday's exam, the lung volumes have decreased, accentuating bibasilar atelectasis and crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. Mild cardiomegaly has also increased. Retrocardiac atelectasis is similar. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. A small left effusion may be present.
