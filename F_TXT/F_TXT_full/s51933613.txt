A bedside AP radiograph of the chest redemonstrates the multifocal opacities of which the right upper lobe lesion was biopsied. The scapula now overlies this site, which may obscure local hemorrhage at the biopsy site. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The aorta is stably tortuous but the hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise normal. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
