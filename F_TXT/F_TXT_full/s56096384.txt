No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragms. There is possible subtle opacity projecting over the left mid lung which may be due to overlap of structures although an area of atelectasis, scarring, or small consolidation is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
