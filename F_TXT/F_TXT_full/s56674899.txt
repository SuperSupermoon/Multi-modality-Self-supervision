1. There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema bilaterally. A right chest tube remains in place and there are multiple right posterior lateral rib fractures. There is at least a small right apical lateral pneumothorax. On the left, no obvious pneumothorax is seen although it is somewhat difficult given the extensive overlying subcutaneous emphysema. The previously described left-sided multiple rib fractures are less apparent on the current study due to differences in positioning. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pulmonary edema.
