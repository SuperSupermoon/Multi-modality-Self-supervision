AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. The right central venous line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. The NG tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. There is interval development of perihilar opacities, with mainly perihilar and lower lobe predisposition consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe partial atelectasis can be assessed on a chest CT, partially imaged and further attention to this area on subsequent radiographs as well as potentially assessment with chest CT might be considered.
