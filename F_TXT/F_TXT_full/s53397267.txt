Rotated positioning, which considerably distorts in limits assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Allowing for this, there are sternotomy wires and a prosthetic valve, mid probable prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Possible prominence of the left pulmonary artery. Possible background COPD. There is mild vascular plethora. There is patchy opacity at the left lung base, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. A small effusion would be difficult to exclude. Possible minimal blunting at the right costophrenic angle. Atelectasis at the right base cannot be excluded.
