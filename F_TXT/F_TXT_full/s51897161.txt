As compared to previous radiograph from earlier today, bilateral pleural catheters remain in place. Right pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size, potentially due to adjustment of the tube in the interval between the studies, although positional differences between the radiographs may contribute to this apparent change as well. No other relevant changes.
