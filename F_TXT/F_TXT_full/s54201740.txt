Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The right-sided PICC line and tracheostomy tube are unchanged in position. There are markedly low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings. There is likely due to atelectasis at the lung bases. The left lung appears slightly more dense than the right. This may be due to the low lung volumes, however, mild pulmonary edema is possible. No pneumothoraces are identified.
