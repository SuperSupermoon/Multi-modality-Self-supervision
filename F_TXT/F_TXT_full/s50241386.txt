AP chest compared to ___: Moderate pulmonary edema has not improved appreciably since ___. The large air collection along the right border of the lower mediastinum which enlarged postoperatively after ___ has not improved. Two right pleural drains, one apical and one basal are still in place. The fullness in the upper mediastinum is probably due to venous engorgement. No left pneumothorax. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube can be traced as far as the lower esophagus.
