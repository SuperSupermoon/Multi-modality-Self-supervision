There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which ends 2.8 cm above the carina. A right-sided PICC is in the mid SVC and is unchanged in position. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm however its tip is not clearly identified. There is increased opacity throughout both lungs consistent with persistent pulmonary edema and significant bibasilar atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
