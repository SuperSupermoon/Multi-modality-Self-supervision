AP portable view of the chest once again demonstrates mild cardiomegaly and vascular congestion. The prior intersitial edema has improved since the prior study. A small right pleural effusion and perhaps a small left pleural effusion are probably stable from the prior studies. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is noted. No focal consolidations to suggest pneumonia.
