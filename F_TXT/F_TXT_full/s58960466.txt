Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Pulmonary edema is superimposed on diffuse granular interstitial pulmonary abnormality, which may represent infectious process or drug reaction. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation.
