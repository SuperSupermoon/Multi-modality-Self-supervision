Supine portable AP view of the chest provided. Evaluation limited due to severe dextroscoliotic deformity and kyphotic angulation of the chest. Allowing for this, no definite signs of pneumonia or overt CHF. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette appears essentially stable.
