A tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. Left-sided PICC is in unchanged position and terminates in the upper SVC. There is stable moderate cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is stable mild pulmonary edema. The lung volumes are low bilaterally. There is an unchanged, moderate left pleural effusion. Apparent interval increase in right basilar opacity may reflect an enlarging right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis or a more supine position of the patient.
