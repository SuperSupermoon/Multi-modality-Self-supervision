New lucency at the right lung base reflects interval fluid drainage. No pulmonary markings are seen within this area, and a small pneumothorax is suspected. There appears to be slightly improved aeration within the right upper lobe. A small left pleural effusion is present. Multiple nodular opacities throughout the left lung are unchanged, denoting known metastases.
