AP portable upright view of the chest. Right IJ access dialysis catheter is noted with its tip in the region of the low SVC versus cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are markedly low which limits evaluation. There is bilateral lower lung atelectasis. The mid upper lungs appear well aerated. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable with slightly unfolded thoracic aorta. No acute bony abnormalities. Several rounded hyperdensities overlying the right hemidiaphragm could be external to the patient.
