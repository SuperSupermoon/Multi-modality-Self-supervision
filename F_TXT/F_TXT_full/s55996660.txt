The NG and endotracheal tubes have been removed. The right CVL ends in the mid SVC, stable. Left-sided chest tube ends at the left lung base although the position has changed from the prior study. Two mediastinal chest tubes remain at the level of the carina and just above the carina, stable. A small right apical pneumothorax persists while the left apical pneumothorax has nearly resolved. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains unchanged.
