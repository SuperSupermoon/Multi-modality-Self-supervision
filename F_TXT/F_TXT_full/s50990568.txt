As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal improvement in translucency of the lung parenchyma, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. However, changes are still massive, with cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema and areas of basal atelectasis. Presence of a small left pleural effusion on today's radiograph cannot be excluded. Known healed right rib fractures.
