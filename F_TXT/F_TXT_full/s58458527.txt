In comparison with the study of ___, there is now an endotracheal tube in place, with the tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach. Pacemaker device remains in place. Hyperlucency in the upper lungs is again seen consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. There are some areas of increased opacification in the bases bilaterally. Some of this most likely reflects redistribution of blood flow related to the upper zone emphysema. However, there may be some pulmonary vascular congestion related to overhydration. In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia on one or both sides would have to be considered.
