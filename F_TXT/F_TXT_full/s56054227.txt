In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, overlying structures make it difficult to assess for pneumothorax, though no large pneumothorax is identified. There is extensive subcutaneous gas along the lateral chest wall, especially in the lower chest and upper abdomen. Multiple rib fractures are again seen. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels again is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, most likely due to over hydration. Endotracheal tube remains in good position. There has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends at least to the antrum.
