Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear except for left basal linear opacity, most likely reflecting atelectasis, but correlation with PA and lateral view to exclude other underlying process is recommended. Adjacent to this atelectasis, there is semicircular opacity projecting over the diaphragm, potentially can represent nodule, again can be reevaluated in PA and lateral views. If the patient cannot obtain PA and lateral views, chest CT might be recommended.
