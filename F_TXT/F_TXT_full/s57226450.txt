Compared to preprocedure chest radiograph earlier today, 12:26. Some of the dependent component of the moderate right pleural effusion has drained following insertion of a right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter. Tip of the catheter has an un familiar appearance and should be evaluated by the clinical team managing it to make sure it has not been distorted. There is no pneumothorax. Adjacent right lower lobe remains heterogeneous ___ opacified, at least atelectatic. The moderate apical loculation of right pleural effusion has not changed. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Left lung and pleural space are grossly normal.
