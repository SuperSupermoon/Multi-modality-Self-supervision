In comparison the previous study from earlier the same date, support and monitoring devices remain in standard position. Moderately severe pulmonary edema has slightly changed in distribution but is overall similar in severity. Note is made of slight improvement in aeration in the left retrocardiac region. No other relevant change in the short interval between the 2 studies.
