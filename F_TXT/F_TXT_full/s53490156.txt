Interval improvement since ___ of the focal increased opacity with air bronchograms and associated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm in the right lung base, favoring atelectasis over a developing infection. Otherwise, no significant interval change. Stable prominent cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum. Stable bilateral low lung volumes. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The trach appears appropriately positioned and is seen on-end. The position of the left PICC line appears unchanged. The left-sided VP shunt is only clearly seen down to the level of the mid and lower thorax, but a sulcal likely unchanged.
