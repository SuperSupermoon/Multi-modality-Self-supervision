Bilateral chest tubes and right subclavian central line are unchanged in position. There is a stable small apical and lateral left pneumothorax. No right-sided pneumothorax is appreciated. There is improved aeration at the left lung base with residual patchy opacity likely reflecting atelectasis. Right lateral pleural thickening and elliptical opacity in the right mid lung likely represent loculated pleural fluid. Patchy opacity at the right base does not appear to be significantly changed and again most likely represent atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. There is less opacity in the left superior mediastinum suggesting that the previously seen abnormality likely reflected a component of left upper lobe atelectasis, less likely hemorrhage. Heart remains stably enlarged.
