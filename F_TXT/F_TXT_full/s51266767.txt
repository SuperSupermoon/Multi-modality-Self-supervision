The heart is moderately enlarged. The aortic arch is calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The lung volumes are low. Calcified pleural plaques are present. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Band-like opacity in the left mid lung suggests minor atelectasis or scarring. Pulmonary vessels are somewhat engorged centrally suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension if not frank pulmonary edema. There is a confluent right basilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia.
