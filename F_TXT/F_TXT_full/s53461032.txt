Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is enlarged. Widening of the mediastinum most likely reflect fat deposition. Bilateral consolidations most likely represent areas of atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded. No appreciable fluid is seen although small amount cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
