There are low lung volumes. Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 3.6 cm above level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. There is left greater than right perihilar opacity which may relate to pulmonary edema; however, additional left infrahilar opacity/left basilar opacity is seen which could be due to aspiration and/or infection. No large pleural effusions are seen, although trace effusions will be difficult to exclude. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
