AP supine portable view of the chest was obtained. The endotracheal tube is low in position, terminating approximately 1 cm above the level of the carina and should be withdrawn by at least 2 cm. The endotracheal tube balloon appears overinflated. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, extending to the expected position of the stomach. There are right greater than left pulmonary opacities. There may be a small left pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Prominence of the central vasculature suggests a component of pulmonary edema. Lucency projecting over the left lower hemithorax is seen to represent a likely loculated pneumothorax vs less likely bulla on subsequent chest CT.
