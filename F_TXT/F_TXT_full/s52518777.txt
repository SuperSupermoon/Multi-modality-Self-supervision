A nasogastric tube is seen, coursing below the level of the diaphragm, extending to the expected location of the stomach. There are air distended loops of bowel not well evaluated on this study. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. A tortuous aorta is again seen, similar in appearance to the chest radiograph from ___. Slight prominence of the ascending aorta may be technical and due to tortuosity, although mild dilatation of the ascending aorta is not excluded.
