Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed. When compared to the prior study, there has been interval increase of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications that are worse on the right. Opacifications obscure the cardiac and mediastinal contours that are otherwise normal. The costophrenic angles are clear and there is no pneumothorax. The soft tissues and bones are unchanged.
