In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. There has been the development of increased opacification at the right base with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with a combination of layering effusion and basilar atelectatic changes. Continued silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small effusion. In view of the extensive parenchymal changes, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
