Pleural effusions and interstitial edema is now largely resolved. Well inflated lungs are clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are now normal, with reduction in previously noted central vascular engorgement. Peripheral pulmonary vascularity is stably engorged without frank interstitial edema.
