There are bilateral left-greater-than-right pleural effusions, perhaps increased in size on the right when compared to prior. Increased interstitial markings are seen superiorly suggesting pulmonary edema. Calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are identified. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged also similar compared to prior.
