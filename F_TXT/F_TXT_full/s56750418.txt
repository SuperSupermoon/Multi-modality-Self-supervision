In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip about 3 cm above the carina. Dobbhoff tube has been pulled back so that the tip lies in the mid esophagus. This was noted by the clinician, since it has been removed prior to this report being issued. There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax as on the previous study. This most likely represents combination of substantial volume loss in the left lung as well as pleural effusion. Obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to determine the degree of displacement of mediastinal contents to the left. On the right, there are ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
