An endotracheal tube has been placed, which terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its tip not visualized. Hilar fullness on each side as well as large indistinct pulmonary vessels is most suggestive of a pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
