Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. A left-sided dual lead pacer remains in place. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema. Note is made of bibasilar atelectasis. The upper lung fields are clear. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely secondary to scarring/atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
