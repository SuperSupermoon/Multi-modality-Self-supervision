Comparison is made with prior study ___. Increased opacity in the right lower lobe is consistent with atelectasis and small right pleural effusion. There are low lung volumes. There is no evident pneumothorax. Mild vascular congestion is unchanged. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has increased consistent with increasing atelectasis. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position.
