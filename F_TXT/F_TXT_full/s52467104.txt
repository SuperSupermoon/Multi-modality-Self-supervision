In comparison with the study of ___, there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, suggesting some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Streak of atelectasis or possible prior fluid in the minor fissure is seen. Atelectatic changes are noted at the retrocardiac region. There is some relatively ill-defined opacification in the left hilar and perihilar region. Although this could merely reflect some asymmetric pulmonary edema, the possibility of a superimposed infection would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There is dilatation of loops of gas-filled bowel in the abdomen, raising the possibility of adynamic ileus.
