Interval extubation. The pulmonary arteries remain enlarged consistent with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. More rounded appearance to the right hilum may be entirely vascular etiology although lymphadenopathy should also be considered. Right upper lobe nodular opacities are again seen and warrant comparison to remote studies or further imaging with CT. The right hemidiaphragm is now indistinct which suggests that there is likely a developing infiltrate, either secondary to aspiration or pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
