1. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract, unchanged. A Dual-lead left-sided pacer remains in place. A left tube remains in place. Lung volumes are markedly diminished with streaky bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis. Evaluation for left effusion is limited due to the pacemaker projecting over the left costophrenic region. No large pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. There is, however, crowding of the pulmonary vasculature related to the markedly diminished lung volumes. Overall the cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in aeration and positioning. Clips in the right upper quadrant are consistent with prior cholecystectomy. Status post median sternotomy for CABG.
