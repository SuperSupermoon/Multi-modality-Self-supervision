Worsening bilateral areas of widespread airspace consolidation, which are most coalescent in the central, perihilar regions. The airspace opacities obscure the cardiac contours, precluding assessment of heart size. The opacities spare the extreme lung periphery. Observed findings may be due to pulmonary edema considering the central coalescence. Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary hemorrhage, widespread infection, and ARDS.
