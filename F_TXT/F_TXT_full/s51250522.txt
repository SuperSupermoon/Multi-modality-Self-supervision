Compared to the prior study and allowing for technical differences, the left IJ central line has been removed and no pneumothorax is detected. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are bibasilar opacities and upper zone re-distribution, with mild vascular blurring. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No gross effusion.
