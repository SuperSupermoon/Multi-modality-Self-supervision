As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient shows the hyperextended stomach. The hyperextended stomach displaces the left hemidiaphragm upwards. In addition, there is newly appeared left retrocardiac and left lower lobe atelectasis, combined to blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially suggestive of mild left pleural effusion. The right lung bases also shows minimal basal atelectasis. Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable. No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Left distal clavicular fracture with mild displacement is noted.
