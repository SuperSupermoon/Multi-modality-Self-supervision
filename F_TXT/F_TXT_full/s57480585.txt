The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. There is vague veil-like opacity projecting over the apical regions of each lung, but suspected to represent an artifact associated with soft tissue attenuation. The lungs themselves appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Mild leftward convex curvature is noted along the lower thoracic spine.
