Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and accompanied by widened vascular pedicle, pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate pulmonary edema. A more confluent area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region could reflect atelectasis or clinically suspected aspiration. Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to ensure clearing of edema and to exclude underlying aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Small pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
