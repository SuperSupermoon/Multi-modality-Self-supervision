There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum following recent bronchoscopic biopsy procedure. As compared to chest radiograph of ___, multifocal airspace and interstitial opacities appear relatively similar in the right lung, but show slight worsening in the periphery of the left mid lung and improvement more centrally in the left juxta hilar region. The apparent area of worsening could potentially represent post bronchoscopy changes, and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged
