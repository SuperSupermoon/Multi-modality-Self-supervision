New opacification on the left lower lung, without air bronchograms, consistent with atelectasis and/or effusion. The right lung is clear. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Bilateral pulmonary vascular engorgement without pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. The heart is top-normal in size, unchanged. Stable mediastinal and hilar contours. The upper thoracic and lower cervical spine fixation devices appear intact and unchanged in position. The left PICC terminates in the region of the cavoatrial junction, as before.
