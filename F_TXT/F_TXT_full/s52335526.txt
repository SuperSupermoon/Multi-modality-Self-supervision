Atelectasis is noted at the left lung base. The previously noted linear opacity at the right mid lung is not clearly visualized on this study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. No left pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. A right chest Port-A-Cath terminates in the distal SVC.
