Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There are low lung volumes. Right PICC tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient and better inspiratory effort. Left lower lobe atelectasis has minimally improved. Drains project in the right abdomen. There are no new lung abnormalities or pulmonary edema.
