AP chest compared to ___, 5:36 p.m.: Tip of the endotracheal tube has been partially withdrawn, now no less than 3 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube loops in the stomach ending in the fundus. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion have both improved, and there is no pulmonary edema. Greater opacification at the base of the left lung is probably a combination of persistent atelectasis and increasing small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
