Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 3.3 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back 1-2 cm for more optimal placement. There is a nasogastric tube whose side port is near the GE junction. This could be advanced several centimeters for more optimal placement. There is stable cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. There is some slight prominence of pulmonary vascular markings and some atelectasis versus developing infiltrate at the right base. No pneumothoraces are present.
