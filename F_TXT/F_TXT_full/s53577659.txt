Portable semi-upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacity partially obscures left hemidiaphragm. Left costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive of small pleural effusion. The right lung is clear. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is normal. There is no pulmonary edema. Partially imaged abdomen is unremarkable.
