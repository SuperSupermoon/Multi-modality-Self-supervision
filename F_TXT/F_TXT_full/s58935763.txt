There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous line with the tip terminating in the mid-to-lower SVC. An endotracheal tube terminating below the thoracic inlet 2.9 cm above the carina. There has been interval removal of a transcutaneous pacemaker from the most recent prior study. A left pectoral pacemaker with a single lead terminating in the right ventricular apex is stable. Calcification at the cardiac apex is also unchanged. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but stable. The lungs are clear without large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is seen. The pulmonary vasculature is essentially within normal limits.
