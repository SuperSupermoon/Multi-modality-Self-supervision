New hilar and perihilar opacities with a small right pleural effusion are consistent with pulmonary edema. Two round opacities in the peripheral mid and lower left lung may also reflect pulmonary edema, but superimposed infection is not excluded. Bibasilar atelectasis or consolidation is also present, given obscuration of both hemidiaphragms. The size of cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess given the prominent perihilar opacities.
