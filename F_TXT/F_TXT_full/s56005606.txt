Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a more focal area of consolidation within the lung bases, particularly on the left side. This may represent developing pneumonia. There is a left retrocardiac opacity as well. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3.4 cm above the carina. There is a right-sided central line with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. An old healed right humeral head fracture is seen.
