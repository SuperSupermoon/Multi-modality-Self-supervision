Interval extubation, removal of the nasogastric tube and the right Swan-Ganz catheter. Removal of the chest tubes. The right internal jugular introducer remains in place. The patient is status post median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement and stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Lung volumes are slightly lower and there is increasing airspace process, likely reflecting worsening pulmonary edema. In addition, there is more focal consolidation in the retrocardiac region which likely reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a layering pleural effusion. There is a very small right apical pneumothorax. Followup imaging would be advised to assess for interval change. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are consistent with prior cholecystectomy. Hardware is seen overlying the mid cervical spine. ___ was text paged of the presence of a pneumothorax on ___ at 3:45 p.m.
