The patient is status post median sternotomy and valve replacement along with CABG. The heart remains stably enlarged. Overall, aeration in both lungs has improved with only streaky opacities seen at both bases which likely reflects residual atelectasis or scarring. However, there now is visualized a 1.2 cm nodular opacity in the right mid to lower lung and further imaging evaluation with dedicated chest CT is advised at this time. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large effusions.
