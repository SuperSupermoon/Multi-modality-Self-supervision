Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube is in standard position. Left IJ catheter tip is in the low SVC. Two NG tubes are present; one, the tip is in the distal esophagus, unchanged; the second, the tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiac size is normal. Apparent widened mediastinum is unchanged. Multifocal airspace consolidations greater in the right lung have worsened, especially in the right lower lobe and medially in the right upper lobe. This is superimposed to more chronic distortion of the architecture, emphysema, and loss of volume of the upper lobes bilaterally. Apical pleural thickening is unchanged. The amount of right pleural effusion is difficult to assess.
