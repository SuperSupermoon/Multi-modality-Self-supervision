The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube passes into the stomach, its tip not imaged. A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Allowing for technique, the heart is probably normal in size. Each hilum is enlarged and indistinct suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion. In addition, there is a focal right upper lobe opacity. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
