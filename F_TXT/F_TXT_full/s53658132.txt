Rotated positioning. An ET tube is present. The tip lies at the mid clavicular heads, 4.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip overlying gastric fundus. The sideport not well visualized, but may lie above the level of the GE junction. Allowing for positioning, mild prominence the cardiomediastinal silhouette, with prominence of the right paratracheal venous vasculature, is probably unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. No focal infiltrate or effusion is detected. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
