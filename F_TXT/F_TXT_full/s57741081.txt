Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Subtle patchy right base opacities in the region of skinfold may be due to overlying soft tissue, although infection or aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. The left lung is clear. Overall, the lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
