Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, persistent pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by slight improvement in extent of interstitial edema. Moderate left and small to moderate right pleural effusions appear slightly larger, but positional differences may potentially contribute to this apparent change. No other relevant changes since recent study.
