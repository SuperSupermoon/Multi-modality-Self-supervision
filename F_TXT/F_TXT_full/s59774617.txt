Since the prior study, there is interval progression of bilateral interstitial opacities most likely representing chronic interstitial lung disease, potentially fibrosis. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including cardiomegaly. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The lung volumes are low. Assessment of the patient with chest CT for precise characterization of the severity and extent of pulmonary abnormalities might be considered.
