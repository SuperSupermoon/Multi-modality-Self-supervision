The ET tube terminates approximately 5.6 cm above the carina. There has been interval retraction of the intra-aortic balloon pump with the radiopaque marker now projecting over the proximal descending aorta. Swan-Ganz catheter continues to terminate in the right main pulmonary artery and should be pulled back if desired location is in the main pulmonary outflow tract. Small bilateral pleural effusions are persistent; however, there has been interval improvement of the diffuse mild pulmonary edema. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is persistent. Enteric tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
