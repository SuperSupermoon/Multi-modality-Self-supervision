A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The patient is rotated and the chin obscures the left apex. Lung volumes are slightly lower than on the prior study. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation and no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly are unchanged.
