Heart size remains mildly enlarged with left ventricular predominance. The aorta demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications and is tortuous as seen previously. Hilar contours are similar. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Streaky and patchy opacities in the bases are new from previous study which may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded. A trace left pleural effusion also appears new compared to the prior study. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Remote left-sided rib fractures are again noted. Marked degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are present.
