AP chest compared to ___: Large bilateral pleural effusions have increased, accompanied by increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and probable mild pulmonary edema. Greater opacification at the lung bases could be due to atelectasis and edema alone, but radiographically one cannot exclude pneumonia. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax. Heart is substantially obscured, but is at least mildly enlarged. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:30 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
