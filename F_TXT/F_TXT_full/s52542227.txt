AP single view chest x-ray shows reduced lung volumes with increased bilateral opacities, denser to the right due to interval increase of pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion. Heart size is still moderately enlarged with left retrocardiac double contour opacity, compatible with small hiatal hernia. There is no pneumothorax.
