AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. High-positioned diaphragms indicate poor inspirational effort and conceal major portion of heart shadow. It also results in crowded appearance of the pulmonary basal vasculature, but there is no evidence of any pulmonary infiltrate and the lateral pleural sinuses are free. No pneumothorax in the apical area. Skeletal structures of the thorax quite unremarkable as can be identified on single view. There exists no prior chest examination or records available for comparison.
