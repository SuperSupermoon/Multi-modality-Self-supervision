There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size is enlarged. Evaluation for sternal mets would be very limited on this study. However, there is a known destructive mass in the sternal well assess on the prior CT scan from ___. There is a 3.8 cm mass in the lateral aspect of the left upper lobe, also better assessed on the prior CT scan. There are no pneumothoraces or signs for overt pulmonary edema. There is increased density about the left breast consistent with known soft tissue masses.
