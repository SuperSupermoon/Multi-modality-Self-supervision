AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lung volumes are low, but there does seem to be consolidation at both lung bases, more likely pneumonia than atelectasis. Heart size is normal and the mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Central adenopathy could be present at the left hilus. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely. No pneumothorax.
