Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of ET tube in standard position with distal tip 2 cm above the level of the carina. There has been mild interval worsening of the left basilar opacification, likely representing consolidation as well as mild interval worsening of the right basilar opacification, which likely represents pleural fluid. Esophageal feeding tube is seen in standard position below the level of the diaphragm with distal tip in the proximal stomach. Two pigtail catheters are seen projecting over the left and right mid abdomen, respectively The previously demonstrated pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly are unchanged on this exam. There is no pneumothorax.
