AP portable view of the chest. Enteric tube ends just distal to the gastroesophageal junction with side port in the distal esophagus. Compared to prior study, there are new bilateral basilar opacities which may represent aspiration given the increase in opacities over the short interval time. Small bilateral pleural effusions are new. No pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.
