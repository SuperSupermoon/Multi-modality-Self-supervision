Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Diffuse bilateral lung consolidations, larger on the right side, have increased in the left lower lobe consistent with worsening multifocal pneumonia. There is no evident pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC. Esophageal stent is in unchanged position. Right lower opacity is unchanged, is a combination of a pneumonic consolidation. Previously present fluid collection in the right lower lung is difficult to evaluate. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
