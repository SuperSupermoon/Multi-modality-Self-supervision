Single portable view of the chest. No prior. Low lung volumes are seen. There is increased density projecting over the first right anterior costochondral cartilage. This could be potentially due to degenerative changes; however, given asymmetry, two-view chest x-ray suggested when patient is amenable. Otherwise, lungs are grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. No free air is seen below the diaphragm.
