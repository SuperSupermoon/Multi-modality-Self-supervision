Endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina. Enteric catheter courses below the left hemidiaphragm loops in the stomach and travels out of view. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Streaky opacification in the retrocardiac space likely represents atelectasis, though infection/aspiration is not excluded in the clinical setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
