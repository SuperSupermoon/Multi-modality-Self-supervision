There is increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. A small amount of left pleural fluid cannot be excluded. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured, but the heart does not appear frankly enlarged. The mediastinum remains midline. There is platelike atelectasis in the right mid zone. A small (4.3 mm) rounded density in the right upper zone laterally overlying the right third anterior most likely represents a calcified granuloma. The lungs are otherwise clear, without focal infiltrate, CHF, or right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
