In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are stable. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, but there is increased engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with worsening pulmonary edema. Opacification of the right lower lung with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with a moderate right pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis at the base. Less prominent effusion and volume loss in the lower lobe on the left.
