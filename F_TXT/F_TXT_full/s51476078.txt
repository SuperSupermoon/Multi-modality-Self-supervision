Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard positions. Cardiomegaly is stable. Increased opacities in the right lower lobe are consistent with increasing effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema has worsened. There are low lung volumes. Left retrocardiac opacities are stable, a combination of effusion and atelectasis. Worsening opacities in the right perihilar region could be also a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but aspiration could be also present.
