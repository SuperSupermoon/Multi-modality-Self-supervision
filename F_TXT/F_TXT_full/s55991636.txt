Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, but pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, and previously present interstitial edema in the left lung has resolved. There remains a confluent patchy airspace opacification in the right lung, most prominent in the perihilar region. Additionally, a small-to-moderate partially loculated right pleural effusion is demonstrated as well as a small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis has improved.
