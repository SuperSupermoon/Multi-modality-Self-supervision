Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier. Cardiac size is top normal. The main pulmonary arteries appear to be enlarged suggesting pulmonary hypertension. Aside from a faint opacity in the right lower lobe there is likely atelectasis; otherwise the lungs are clear. There is no evident pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
