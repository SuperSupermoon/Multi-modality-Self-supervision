Small biapical pneumothoraces are present. The left apical pneumothorax is in retrospect similar to prior study allowing for positional differences, and the right apical pneumothorax is apparently new, but could have been obscured by supine positioning on the previous study. Status post removal of various indwelling support and monitoring devices with residual right internal jugular central venous catheter sheath remaining in place. Slight interval increase in size of the heart, with persistent pulmonary vascular congestion. Change in distribution of combined alveolar and interstitial edema pattern, which is probably of overall similar severity. Coexisting atelectasis is likely present in the lung bases, as well as bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate in size.
