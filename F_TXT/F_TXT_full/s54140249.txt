As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has been slightly pulled back. Currently, the tube projects approximately 5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction. The sidehole is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. For secure positioning within the stomach, the tube should be advanced by approximately 5-8 cm. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, with exception of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt that was not apparent on the previous image.
