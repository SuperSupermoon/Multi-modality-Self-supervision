Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged as compared to baseline radiograph of ___, and note is made of distention of the azygos contour since that time. Widespread bilateral airspace opacities are present diffusely, with relative sparing of the extreme lung periphery. As compared to the recent radiograph of ___, the severity of the central airspace disease has slightly improved. There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions present. Considering the improvement and history of lasix therapy, this probably reflects pulmonary edema, but continued followup recommended to exclude other causes of diffuse airspace disease including widespread pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and ARDS.
