Left superior mediastinal mass with associated tracheal displacement and narrowing is consistent with known thyroid enlargement better evaluated on recent CT neck. Mild cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema. Additional patchy bibasilar opacities could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or developing pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
