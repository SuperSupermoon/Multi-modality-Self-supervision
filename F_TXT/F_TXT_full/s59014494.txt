A left internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC, unchanged. The lungs remain hyperinflation. Right mid to upper lung aeration has slightly improved. There is persistent mild bibasilar atelectasis as well as unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Enlargement of the hila likely relates to dilation of the pulmonary arteries, similar to the prior study. There is no pneumothorax.
