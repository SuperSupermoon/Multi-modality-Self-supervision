AP chest compared to ___: The volume and radiodensity of large scale consolidation in the right lung both improved substantially between ___ and ___. Subsequently, although the overall volume of affected lung has decreased, the severity of consolidation in the right lower lobe has progressed, accompanied by only mild volume loss, reflected in only slight rightward mediastinal shift and elevation of the right lung base. The central airways are patent. It would not be justified to call the lung findings atelectasis, and although the change could be due to organization of a healing pneumonia, but I think a more likely alternative is recrudescent pneumonia due to a resistant or inadequately treated pathogen. Heart size is normal, decreased since ___. Left lung is grossly clear. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. These findings and their significance were discussed with the referring physician, ___ ___, at 12:00 noon.
