AP chest compared to ___, 4:08 p.m.: Large left and moderate right pleural effusion are increasing. Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement are longstanding. Borderline interstitial edema is unchanged. Given the severe abnormalities as described, concurrent pneumonia would be difficult to detect, although there is new left perihilar opacification that bears watching as a possible early pneumonia, difficult to separate from the pleural fluid around it.
