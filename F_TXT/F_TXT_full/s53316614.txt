There has been interval placement of a left Pleurx catheter with tip terminating near the aortic knob. There has been interval slight decrease in the now small left pleural effusion with resultant improvement in the left basilar atelectasis. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Multiple left lateral upper rib deformities as well as the left clavicular deformity are likely sequela of prior trauma. Deformity of the right clavicular head may be secondary to an inflammatory arthritic process.
