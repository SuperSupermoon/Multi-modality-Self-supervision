1. Right subclavian central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing distally with the tip not identified on the current study. There continue to be bibasilar airspace opacities, which have slightly worsened on the left when compared to the prior study and most likely represent bibasilar atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Possible small layering left effusion. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
