Allowing for supine AP portable technique and low lung volumes, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably within normal limits. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Irregular contours along the left posterior lateral fifth and sixth ribs suggest prior fractures, but probably not recent.
