Pleural catheters remain in place in the left hemithorax with persistent moderate-to-large multiloculated left effusion. Tiny loculated hydropneumothoraces are present, and shown to better detail on CT of one day earlier. Multifocal lymphadenopathy in the mediastinal and hilar regions has also been more fully characterized by CT. Small right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size, and diffuse bronchovascular and peripheral interstitial opacities in the right mid and lower lung are again demonstrated, likely due to history of Kaposi's sarcoma.
