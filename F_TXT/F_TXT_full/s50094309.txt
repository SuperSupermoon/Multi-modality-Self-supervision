Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is mild left base atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, evidence of a pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely in part exaggerated by AP technique. The aorta is tortuous. Hilar contours are stable. Multiple old left-sided rib fractures are again seen.
