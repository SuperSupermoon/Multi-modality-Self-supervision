The ET tube tip is 4.4 cm above the carina. Bilateral chest tubes, feeding tube with tip off the film, Swan-Ganz catheter with tip in the pulmonary outflow tract, right atrial canula, and midline drains are unchanged. There is increased opacity at the right base likely representing increased infiltrate in that region. There is still hyperlucency seen in the left lower lung likely representing an inferior pneumothorax. This is slightly less prominent on the current study than on the prior.
