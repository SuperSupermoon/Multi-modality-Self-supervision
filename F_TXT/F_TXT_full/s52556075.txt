There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube. Lung volumes remain low. There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. There are airspace opacities at both the right and left bases, this is nonspecific in appearance but could reflect pulmonary edema or infection. There is increased aeration, projected on the right side when compared to the prior study. Given the relatively rapid improvement, pulmonary edema is considered more likely. A right-sided subclavian catheter terminates in the mid SVC. A nasoenteric tube is in-situ, the tip is not visualized in this study but lies below the left hemidiaphragm. Prominence of the hila and pulmonary vasculature consistent with fluid overload.
