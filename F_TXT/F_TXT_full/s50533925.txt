A left chest tube remains in place superimposed on the left lower lung. Bibasilar opacity remains, with increased veil-like opacity over the right lower lung, likely reflecting worsening effusion. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged, mediastinal widening is improving over time. The pulmonary vasculature, however, is normal. An endotracheal tube, NG tube, two mediastinal drains, right IJ sheath, Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip in the main pulmonary artery, and median sternotomy wires are unchanged in appearance.
