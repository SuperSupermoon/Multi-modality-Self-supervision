As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular vein catheter in correct position, with the tip projecting over the mid SVC. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. The pre-existing extensive parenchymal opacities are slightly decreased, potentially as a consequence of intubation. No new focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
