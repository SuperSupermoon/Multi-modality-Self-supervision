Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. In this patient with known small cell lung cancer, there is stable soft tissue density/prominence of the right pulmonary hilum which is unchanged from prior exams. There is a small right pleural effusion which appears stable from prior exam and is somewhat loculated, tracking along the right lung apex. There is no overt evidence of pneumonia. There are subtle nodular opacities within the periphery of both lungs which are of unknown etiology or significance. Overall heart size appears stable. Bony structures are intact.
