Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Low lung volumes are present. Bronchovascular structures are crowded as result of low lung volumes, but there is no pulmonary edema. Chronic interstitial opacities are noted bilaterally, most pronounced at the periphery. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Re- demonstrated is a comminuted fracture of the right proximal humerus. Multiple surgical anchors are seen over the projecting over the left humeral head.
