1. A right pleural catheter remains in place, and there is a stable right moderate-sized pneumothorax. The right lung remains encased and has a very heterogeneous attenuation which likely reflects a combination of a known right upper lobe mass and nodularity consistent with metastatic disease. Left lung remains well inflated and clear with the exception of a 5 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left fourth posterior rib. No left effusion or left pneumothorax. Left heart border is stable. Right heart and mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to the right lung process.
