The patient is intubated, an endotracheal tube is unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study. There are increased bilateral hazy opacities of the lung bases most consistent with pleural effusions. These appear to have increased when compared to the prior study. There is associated increased opacity of the bilateral lung bases, likely reflecting pulmonary edema however infection cannot be excluded. Prominence of the bilateral hila is less marked than on the prior study.
