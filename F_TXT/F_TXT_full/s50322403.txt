Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There is selective intubation in the left main bronchus. The position of the ET tube is unchanged . Complete white-out of the right hemithorax is unchanged, a combination of total collapse of the right lung and pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right. Right subclavian catheter is in unchanged position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinum cannot be evaluated. Right lower lobe opacities have increased. It could be due to increasing atelectasis, a small effusion and/or worsening infection.
