In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. There is again opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Opacification at the left base also is consistent with pleural effusion with mild compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax.
