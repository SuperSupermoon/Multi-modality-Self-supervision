Interval placement of a feeding tube with the tip in the proximal small bowel. Clips in the right upper quadrant are seen, consistent with cholecystectomy. Spinal hardware is seen overlying the visualized mid-to-lower lumbar spine. There are two approximately 1 cm ill-defined patchy opacities in the right upper lung which have developed since the prior study and therefore may represent areas of early aspiration or infection. In a patient with multiple comorbidities, emboli should also be considered. Clinical correlation is advised. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may represent pleural thickening or a small effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Calcification of the aorta, consistent with atherosclerosis.
