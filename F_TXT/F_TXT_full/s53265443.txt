AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Low lung volumes explain bronchovascular crowding, but make it difficult to exclude mild interstitial edema. It also is likely responsible for atelectasis in the left lower lobe simulating consolidation. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volume. Electrode passes from the left low pectoral power pack to the left paraspinal neck.
