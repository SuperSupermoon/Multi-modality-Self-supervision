As compared to chest radiograph from the same day. New right-sided pigtail catheter. Note the right apex is not completely included in this radiograph. Subtle lucency of the right base, could be possible tiny basal pneumothorax. Right upper lobe opacity has marginally improved. Moderate left-sided effusion and dependent opacities have not substantially changed. Dobhoff tube and left-sided PICC in similar position.
