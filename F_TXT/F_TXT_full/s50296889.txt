There are new bibasilar opacities which likely reflect atelectasis, though superimposed aspiration might also have this appearance in this gentleman who presented with seizure. Bilateral apical opacities are new from prior and may reflect developing apical pulmonary edema, possibly from a neurogenic cause. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, the mediastinal contours are normal. An NG tube is in place, the tip is in the stomach with sidehole in the distal esophagus, this may be advanced several centimeters for more optimal positioning. The ET tube tip is positioned ~ 6 cm above the level of the carina.
