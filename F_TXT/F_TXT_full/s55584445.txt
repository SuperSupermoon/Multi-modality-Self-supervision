AP chest compared to ___: In the setting of chronic moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion developed and small right pleural effusion increased between ___ and ___. Today, the vascular congestion is slightly worse. On both studies, there is coalescent opacity at the right lung base medially, and today there could be a new region of consolidation at the right lung apex, though patient is rotated projecting mediastinum and right clavicular head over that region. I discussed with house officer caring for this patient the findings of worsening cardiac decompensation and suggested conventional radiographs to assess whether pneumonia is present as well.
