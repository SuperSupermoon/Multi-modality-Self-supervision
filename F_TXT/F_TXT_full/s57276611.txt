Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates an interval increase in the small right and moderate left pleural effusions with superimposed progression of pulmonary edema. There is stable collapse of the left lower lobe. The heart is stably enlarged. The right pulmonary artery is now even larger than at baseline, suggesting further decompensation of left heart failure. The pneumomediastinum is also enlarged, likely resulting from a combination of lymphadenopathy and vascular engorgement. There is no pneumothorax. A biventricular pacer is once again seen, with leads in unchanged and appropriate position. A left internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Intact sternal cerclage wires, as well as mediastinal surgical clips are redemonstrated. Surgical clips in the upper abdomen are also noted.
