Lung volumes have improved, previous pulmonary edema and vascular engorgement of the peripheral and hilar pulmonary vasculature and mild cardiomegaly have all nearly resolved. A peripheral opacity in the left midlung could be the residual of pneumonia or a lung mass. Imaging of the lower chest on an abdomen CT scan ___ showed a large consolidation in the lingula. Pleural effusion, small if any. Upper lungs clear. I would recommend careful radiographic surveillance with conventional radiographs in no more than 3 weeks.
