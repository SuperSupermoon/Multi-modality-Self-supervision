AP chest compared to ___: ET tube is in standard placement. Newly inserted nasogastric tube is looped widely in the hypopharynx and ends in a hiatus hernia. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions have increased. Severe cardiomegaly is stable, but mediastinal venous engorgement has progressed. Constellation of findings should raise some concern about pericardial effusion and possible tamponade. Cannula projecting over the mediastinum and right heart cannot be localized on single frontal view. Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings at 9:15am.
