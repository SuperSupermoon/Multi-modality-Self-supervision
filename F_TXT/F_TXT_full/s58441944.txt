There has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter which ends in the low SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Linear opacity at the left lung base is most compatible with atelectasis. The thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no focal lung consolidation.
