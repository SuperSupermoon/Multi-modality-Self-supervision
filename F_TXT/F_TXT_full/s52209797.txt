AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study dated ___. On the single AP frontal view, there is no evidence of any pneumonic infiltrates. Heart size is unchanged and within normal limits. No pneumothorax in the apical area. A previously described Dobbhoff line has been advanced further and one notices that the line makes a 360-degree loop in the proximal esophagus at the level of the clavicles. The Dobbhoff line itself has advanced further and its tip exceeds the lower limit of the present image.
