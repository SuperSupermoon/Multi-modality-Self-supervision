Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, slight increase in opacity at the right lung base could be due to summation of shadows, although consolidation cannot be excluded in this setting. Repeat with better inspiration, PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation. The left lung is clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
