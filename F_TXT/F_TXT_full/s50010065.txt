Nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. The distal tip is not included on the radiograph, but is at least within the body of the stomach. Endotracheal tube has been removed. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Lung volumes are lower compared to the recent study. Allowing for this factor, the degree of pulmonary edema is probably similar. There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions present, left greater than right.
