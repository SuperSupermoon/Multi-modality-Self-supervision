A Swan-Ganz catheter is in expected position. An endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above the carina. An enteric tube descends below the field of view but likely terminates within small bowel. Lung volumes are slightly low however the lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
