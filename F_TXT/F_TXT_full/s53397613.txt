Single portable view of the chest. Left PICC is seen with tip in the upper SVC. Right IJ line tip is likely within the right atrium and should be withdrawn for optimal positioning. Low lung volumes again seen. Streaky bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis, although infection is entirely possible. The left basilar opacity on prior has improved.
