Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. There has been interval increase in the right pleural effusion, now moderate, with right basilar atelectasis. Mild edema is also seen. There is no pneumothorax. The presence of the right pleural effusion limits assessment of the right cardiomediastinal contours, but the remainder of the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Median sternotomy wires are in similar configuration with aortic and tricuspid valve replacements.
