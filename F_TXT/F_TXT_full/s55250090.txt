As compared to the previous rib series, there is unchanged evidence of a relatively large consolidation, combined to a surrounding opacity and, likely, small pleural effusion, on the right. The change would be consistent with known recent pneumonia. The chest radiograph shows no visible rib fractures. Taking into consideration an outside hospital CT from ___, a hyperlucency at the lateral aspects of the consolidation likely reflects a pleural air inclusion with an air-fluid level. In addition, the central portions of the consolidation on the CT show an area of necrosis with air inclusions, potentially reflecting parenchymal necrosis or a developing lung abscess. On the CT, the extent of the parenchymal opacities is larger than it appears on the chest x-ray. Close radiographic monitoring is required.
