Cardiac size is difficult to assess due to obscuration of the cardiac contours and large hiatal hernia. This also limits evaluation of the left lower lobe. An area of juxtahilar atelectasis on the left is observed adjacent to the large hernia, and patchy and linear atelectasis are also present at the right lung base. Remainder of the lungs are clear with no areas of consolidation.
