In comparison with the earlier study of this date, following bronchoscopy there has been re-expansion of much of the left lung. Opacification at the base is consistent with some combination of pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lung. There is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Central catheter is unchanged. Right basilar opacification is consistent with effusion and atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
