An OG tube is better visualized on the current study, coursing through the stomach. ETT is in standard position. Since the most recent prior study, there may be slight improvement in the heterogeneous opacities at the lung bases, which is more consistent with resolving edema rather than aspiration. There is no evidence for pneumonia.
