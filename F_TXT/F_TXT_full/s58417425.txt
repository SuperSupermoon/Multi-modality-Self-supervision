As compared to the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, low lying left pleural catheter is present, with near complete resolution of left pleural effusion and development of a small left apical pneumothorax. Airspace opacities in left lower lobe could potentially be due to localized re-expansion edema. Exam is also remarkable for interstitial edema, improving aeration at the right lung base and a persistent small right pleural effusion.
