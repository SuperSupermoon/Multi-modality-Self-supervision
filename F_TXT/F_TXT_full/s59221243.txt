AP chest compared to ___: Right lower lobe collapse is new. Small pneumothorax is seen on each side of the chest, increased on the left in addition to the stable or even decreasing paramediastinal component. Trauma board outlines the mediastinal reflection around the cardiac apex and lends increased lucency to the diaphragmatic region. On the right, there may also be anterior pleural air collection, but more evident is the very small volume of pleural air inferolaterally. Orientation of the right pleural tube has gone from oblique upward to nearly horizontal. Left apical pleural tube is unchanged in position. ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and an upper enteric drainage tube passes into a non-distended stomach. There is no apparent increase in displacement of multiple bilateral rib fractures. Dr. ___ was paged at 11:15 am and we discussed the findings by telephone at 11:25am.
