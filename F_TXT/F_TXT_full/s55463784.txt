Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Previously present pulmonary edema has substantially improved with only minimal residual interstitial edema remaining. Patchy bibasilar opacities probably represent atelectasis as well as a linear focus of atelectasis in the left lung base laterally. Bilateral small pleural effusions are present, and have improved since the previous radiograph. Multifocal post-traumatic deformities are present within the imaged skeletal structures of the thorax.
