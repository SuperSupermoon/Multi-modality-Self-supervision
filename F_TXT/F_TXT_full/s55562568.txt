Single upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a central venous catheter, terminating in the right ventricle, which should be retracted 9 to 10 cm for appropriate position just above the cavoatrial junction. There is elevation of theright hemidiaphragm. Right mid lung opacity may be due to atelectasis secondary to low lung volume on the right; however, infection cannot be excluded. The left lung is grossly clear. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
