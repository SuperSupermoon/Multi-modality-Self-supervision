Portable chest radiograph is provided. Compared to the prior radiograph, lung volumes are severely decreased resulting in bronchovascular crowding. There is now moderate pulmonary edema with enlarged hila and pulmonary vasculature. Opacities at the bases may be atelectasis or more confluent edema; however, infection is also possible.
