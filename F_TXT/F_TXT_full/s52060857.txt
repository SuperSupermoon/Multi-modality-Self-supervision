Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with right hilar prominence again noted. Tracheostomy tube tip remains in unchanged position. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration is not excluded. A trace left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax is identified. Clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen indicate prior cholecystectomy.
