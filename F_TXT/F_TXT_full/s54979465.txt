Lung volumes are somewhat lower than before. There is increased streaky density at the lung bases likely representing subsegmental atelectasis. A very small right apical pneumothorax is probably stable in size. A right chest tube remains in place. The patient is status post median sternotomy and MVR is demonstrated earlier. The patient has been extubated and a nasogastric tube has been withdrawn. Mediastinal drains and the right jugular sheath remain in place.
