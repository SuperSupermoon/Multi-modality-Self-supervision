As compared to ___ chest radiograph, multifocal bilateral pulmonary opacities have slightly worsened, particularly a confluent area of consolidation in the left lower lobe and lingula. These findings are likely due to a combination of pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion has also increased in size although a small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
