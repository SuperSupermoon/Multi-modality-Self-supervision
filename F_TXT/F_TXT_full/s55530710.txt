There has been interval placement of a left basilar chest tube. Small residual pneumothorax seen surrounding the left lung apex. There has been interval re-expansion of the left lower lobe with some parenchymal opacity, potentially residual atelectasis although given older prior, improving infection is also possible. Wedge-shaped right upper lung opacity laterally is unchanged and as previously detailed potentially representing an infarct. Small right pleural effusion is visualized. Chronic underlying changes of the lungs appears similar compatible with patient's underlying emphysema.
