Dual lead right-sided pacer is unchanged. The heart remains enlarged. There are layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities suggestive of partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. Interval improvement but residual mild to moderate pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Calcified mediastinal and hilar nodes as well as a calcified mass at the right apex consistent with prior granulomatous infection. Incidental note made of left shoulder hemiarthroplasty.
