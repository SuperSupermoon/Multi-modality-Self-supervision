As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing opacities at the right lung base have almost completely cleared. Mild atelectasis at the left lung bases persist. There is also blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small pleural effusion on the left. Moderate cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema. Right internal jugular vein catheter is unchanged.
