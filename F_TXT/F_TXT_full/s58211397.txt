AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are lower today, reflected in vascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis, moderate on the right, more severe on the left. Given the low lung volumes, mild interstitial edema would be difficult to detect. There is no large pleural effusion but small volume of left pleural fluid might be present. There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Heart size is top normal. Moderate-sized hiatus hernia is noted. Leftward deviation of the trachea in the neck, contralateral to the side of the new VNS lead, suggests enlargement of the right lobe of the thyroid or other adjacent mass. New or repositioned VNS device in the left lateral chest wall gives rise to VNS device that runs subcutaneously to the left lateral neck where it coils.
