Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Diffuse opacities in the right lung and more focally distributed opacities in the left upper lobe are slightly improved, and may be due to an improving multifocal pneumonia, possibly secondary to aspiration. Sharply demarcated region of increased opacity overlying the left lower hemithorax without obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may be due to superimposed soft tissues of the chest, but attention to this region on followup radiograph is suggested to exclude a developing pleural or parenchymal process in this region.
