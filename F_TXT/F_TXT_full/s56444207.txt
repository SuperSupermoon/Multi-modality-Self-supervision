Left-sided pacer and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter unchanged in position in this patient status post median sternotomy with mitral annular ring and CABG and stable expected postoperative appearance to the cardiac and mediastinal contours. Layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis. Interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema with crowding of the perihilar vasculature due to diminished lung volumes. No pneumothorax.
