As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new orogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube passes the gastroesophageal junction and is currently projecting over the middle parts of the stomach. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The lung bases appear unchanged.
