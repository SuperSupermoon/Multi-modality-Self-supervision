1. Single-lead right-sided pacer remains in place, unchanged in position. A right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. An endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. There are likely small layering bilateral effusions. Retrocardiac consolidation persists and there are also patchy opacities noted at the right base suggestive of atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall, there is no significant interval change.
