Heart is moderately enlarged and the pulmonary vasculature mildly engorged but there is no pulmonary edema or focal pulmonary abnormality. Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. No pneumothorax. Apparent in were displacement of intimal calcification in the aortic arch could be due to the superimposition of different coronal planes, but if there is clinical suspicion of aortic dissection, CTA would be required.
