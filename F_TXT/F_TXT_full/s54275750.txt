AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Lung volumes are chronically low, not improved since ___. Opacification at the base of the right lung is probably a combination of atelectasis and overlying pleural effusion but pneumonia could be present and is best evaluated by conventional radiographs when feasible. Pulmonary vascular congestion in the left lung has worsened indicating some cardiac decompensation although heart size is obscured by adjacent pleural and parenchymal abnormalities. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. No pneumothorax.
