Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from ___. There is engorgement of the central pulmonary vasculature with indistinctness of the vascular markings. There is no confluent consolidation. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be due to technique and overlying soft tissues; however, small effusion is not excluded. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is not significantly changed given differences in positioning and technique. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
