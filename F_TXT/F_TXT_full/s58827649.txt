Portable frontal semiupright radiograph of the chest demonstrates ET tube ending 1.4 cm above the carina. A right PICC are in unchanged position. The NG tube has the tip in the stomach but the side hole at the level of GE junction. There is slight improvement of diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities on a background of severe emphysema with biapical bullae and fibrotic changes, which could represent improving edema. There may be material within the right apical bulla. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
