In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a pigtail catheter at the left base. There has been some decrease in the degree of left effusion and atelectasis. There are two kinks in the catheter, which could be adversely affecting its function. Increased opacification at the right base is consistent with effusion and atelectasis. Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
