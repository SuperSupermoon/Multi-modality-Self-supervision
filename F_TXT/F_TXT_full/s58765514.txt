AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. A previously identified NG tube is again noted reaching below the diaphragm. The patient is moderately rotated to the left, which explains the heart's unusual presentation to the left of spinal column. At least moderate cardiac enlargement is present as it was before. The left-sided diaphragm is obliterated suggesting the possibility of an atelectasis. Finding existed already on the previous examination. General haze mostly over the pulmonary basal vasculature is suggestive of pleural effusions layering in the dependent portions of the posterior pleural sinuses. A previously existing and described right internal jugular approach central venous line remains in place.
