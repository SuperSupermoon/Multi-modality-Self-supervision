Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC. Rounded opacity projecting in the region of the gastroesophageal junction is compatible with a small hiatal hernia. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. The lungs are clear. Chain sutures in the left lower lobe are present. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, though the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
