Lung volumes are unchanged to slightly improved when compared to the prior study. There is persistent visualization of a right basal pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Left lung appears grossly clear within the limitations of this study. A right-sided internal jugular Port-A-Cath terminates in the distal SVC. A right upper quadrant drainage catheter is unchanged in position. Previous median sternotomy noted. No pneumothorax seen.
