The lung volumes are low. Within the limitations of technique, however, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear probably unchanged. There is bilateral perihilar fullness, greater on the left than right, however, with a mild interstitial process, most suggestive of pulmonary congestion. Small pleural effusions are suspected in addition to thickening along the minor fissure. There is no pneumothorax.
