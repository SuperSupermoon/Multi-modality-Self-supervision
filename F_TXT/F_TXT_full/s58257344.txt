Heart size is normal. Opacity projecting adjacent to the right hilus and lower lobe demonstrate a combination of substantial mediastinal lymphadenopathy and potentially interval development of right lower lobe at least partial atelectasis due to an area of the bronchi. The right paratracheal lymphadenopathy is seen as well. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. There is no interval development of pleural effusion.
