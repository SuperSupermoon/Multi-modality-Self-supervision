Frontal chest radiographs demonstrate a a left chest wall pacer device with the leads overlying the bilateral ventricles and right atrium. The heart is likely top-normal in size, with the cardiac silhouette exaggerated by low lung volumes. Diffuse opacity bilaterally is consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema. There are moderate pleural effusions bilaterally, right greater than left. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
