Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The study was made available for my interpretation today, ___ at 3:15 p.m. Endotracheal tube is high in position, terminating approximately 8.5 cm above the level of the carina, and should be advanced approximately 5 cm. What appears to be a nasogastric tube terminates over the mid chest in the midline, presumed in the mid esophagus and is high in position. The lungs are clear. The left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Gaseous distention of the stomach is noted.
