AP chest compared to ___ through ___, at 12:08 p.m.: A very small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged since earlier in the day, small right pleural effusion has increased and right basal consolidation has worsened appreciably. It is almost severe as the abnormality at the left base which is usually atelectasis. On the right, however, one must be concerned about aspiration leading to pneumonia. Mediastinal silhouette has a normal postoperative appearance. Small left pleural effusion is stable. Right jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC but it is sharply folded in its course which could compromise the lumen. ___ and I discussed the findings over the phone.
