AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained ___ hours earlier during the same day. Previously described left subclavian approach central venous line remains in unchanged position. No other indwelling lines are identified. Moderate cardiac enlargement with left ventricular prominence as before. There is now a diffuse haze overlying both lung fields coinciding with obliterated diaphragmatic contours. When comparison is made with the next preceding examination, these findings are new as previously the diaphragms were well identified and the diffuse haze did not exist. A possible explanation is that the patient had pleural effusions obscured in the posterior pleural sinuses that now in supine position distribute evenly in the dependent posterior departments of the pleural space. New discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified, nor is there evidence of any pneumothorax. Requesting physician ___. ___ was paged, but answer was not received at 5:30 p.m. Page number was ___.
