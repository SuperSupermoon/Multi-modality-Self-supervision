There has been interval placement of left chest tube, and near- resolution of left-sided pneumothorax, with possible small left apical pneumothorax not definitively visualized. A right-sided port is in stable position. The Dobbhoff tube again appears to overlie the trachea and enter the left mainstem bronchus, coursing inferiorly and in grossly unchanged position, with tip projecting over the mid left abdomen. The mediastinal silhouette is normal. The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal, however this evaluation is limited by the low lung volumes and AP projection. The right lung is clear without evidence of focal consolidation. There is a generalized diffuse hazy opacification of the left lung which likely represents re-expansion pulmonary edema. There are some areas of platelike atelectasis over the left lower lung. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no significant left pleural effusion, however left lateral CP angle is not seen on current radiograph, which limits evaluation for small effusions.
