The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium. The azygos contour is prominent, which may indicate some degree of fluid overload. The left hemidiaphragm appears elevated, which may be a more chronic finding, but possibly due to atelectasis and volume loss, otherwise not well assessed. Small pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. A mild interstitial abnormality suggests pulmonary vascular congestion, but not severe. There is moderate-to-severe S-shaped curvature to the thoracolumbar spine. A large bubble-like lucency projecting over the epigastrium may be due to gastric or colonic distention. Bones appear demineralized.
