Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Left basilar plate-like atelectasis/scarring is seen. There is also likely right basilar atelectasis/scarring, although right basilar consolidation is not entirely excluded. There has been placement of an enteric tube which courses into the left upper quadrant in the expected location of the stomach. Distended loops of small bowel are better assessed on CT. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
