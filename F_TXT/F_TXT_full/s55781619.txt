There has been some mild improvement in the amount of pulmonary edema. The heart is mildly enlarged. There small bilateral pleural effusions. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution but the hazy alveolar infiltrate has decreased. However there are dense areas of opacification both lower lobes. It is unclear how much of this is due to volume loss or if focal infectious infiltrates are present.
