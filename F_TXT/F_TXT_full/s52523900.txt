There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube which courses toward the mediastinum and projects over the right mediastinum. There has been interval decrease in right mid to lower hemi thorax opacity likely due to fluid removal from chest tube. Residual right mid and lower lung opacities persist which could be due to pulmonary contusion and/or residual atelectasis and possible small right pleural effusion. There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, increased since prior, concerning for interval pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Left basilar atelectasis is present. Right eighth rib fracture is redemonstrated. .
