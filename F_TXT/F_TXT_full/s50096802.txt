Lung volumes are somewhat low. There is streaky density bilaterally most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis or scarring as before. There is evidence of a small right pleural effusion as well. The patient is status post median sternotomy and valvular plasty. A PICC remains in place. It can be followed to the upper superior vena cava. This is slightly higher than the apparent position on the prior study. There is no significant change.
