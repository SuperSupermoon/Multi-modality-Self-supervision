A single portable chest radiograph excludes the left costophrenic angle and is slightly rotated. Within this limitation, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Bibasilar streaky opacifications, left greater than right, likely represent atelectasis, though cannot exclude an infectious process in the appropriate clinical setting. Degenerative changes are noted at the bilateral humeral heads and acromioclavicular joints.
