There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. A small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Since the prior radiograph, there has been increased nodular peribronchial opacification, most readily explained by chronic aspiration. Mild hazy opacification at the left base is unchanged and likely represents chronic atelectasis.
