The patient is substantially rotated and within those limitations, the pre size COMPARISON of the lung basal appearance is difficult but the impression is that there is interval progression in bibasal consolidations. No progression of pulmonary edema is seen. Small bilateral pleural effusion is most likely present. No right internal jugular line is currently noted.
