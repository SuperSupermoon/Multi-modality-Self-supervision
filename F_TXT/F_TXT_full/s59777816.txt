In comparison with the study ___ ___ to, there is little overall change. Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild fullness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. The opacification at the right base, consistent with fluid and atelectasis, is less pronounced on the current study. The possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude, especially in the retrocardiac region, in the absence of a lateral view. The endotracheal tube remains in good position. It is very difficult to see the lower portion of the nasogastric tube, with the tip having been pulled back to the distal esophagus.
