Right IJ central venous catheter is again noted terminating at the level of the cavoatrial junction. There has been interval placement of a pigtail left chest tube which projects over the lateral aspect of the left mid lung. Since prior exam there is decrease in left pleural effusion with partial re-expansion of the left upper lobe. Airspace opacity in the left upper lobe raises potential concern for re-expansion pulmonary edema. A small left apical pneumothorax is noted. There is mild right basal atelectasis. Otherwise the right lung is clear.
