Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Widespread airspace opacities have progressed in the interval, now involving the right lung diffusely as well as the left mid and lower lung regions with relative sparing of the left lung apex. Observed findings likely represent a progressive multifocal pneumonia, but a component of coexisting pulmonary edema is possible. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions have slightly increased in size in the interval. No visible pneumothorax.
