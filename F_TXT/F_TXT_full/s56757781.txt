Radiograph is centered at the diaphragm and excludes the lung apices. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.6 cm above the carina, near the inferior border of the clavicular heads. An enteric tube side port is at least 5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction. Lungs are well-expanded, noting mild linear atelectasis in the lateral left lower lobe. Lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.
