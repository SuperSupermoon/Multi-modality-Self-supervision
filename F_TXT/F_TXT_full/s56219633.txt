AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained three hours earlier during the same day. The position of the ETT has been adjusted and is seen to terminate now 5 cm above the level of the carina. Previously described right internal jugular sheath remains in unchanged position. No pneumothorax or any other new pulmonary abnormalities are seen. The plate-shaped moderately sized atelectasis in the right lower lung field remains unchanged.
