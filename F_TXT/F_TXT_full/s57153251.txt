There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No displaced rib fractures are seen. Cardiac silhouette is normal in size. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Bilateral bibasilar and perihilar opacities are better evaluated on the trauma CT torso from the same day and may be related to aspiration. ET tube terminates 2 cm above the carina and can be retracted for better positioning.
