Current study demonstrates normal heart size and mediastinum. The patient is after median sternotomy due to CABG. There is still presence of mild pulmonary edema noted, in particular in the lower lungs. In the lower lungs it also can be due a contributing atelectasis or infection (correlate clinically). To assess dynamic changes, comparison with prior imaging would be beneficial.
