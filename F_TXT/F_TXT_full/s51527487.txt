Previous mild pulmonary edema is improved, but the focal consolidation in the left midlung laterally has not. It is not entirely clear whether this is a clotting lesion, such as a substantial infection, infarction, or pulmonary hemorrhage, or a loculated pleural collection simulating a lung lesion. Lateral view might be helpful in distinguishing between the 2, and a CT scan would be definitive. ET tube, right internal jugular line, and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the main pulmonary artery as before. Small bilateral pleural effusion is presumed. There is no pneumothorax.
