Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 1:32 p.m. Since the prior study no substantial change has been demonstrated in the cardiomediastinal silhouette, position of pacemaker leads and hemodialysis catheter as well as small bilateral pleural effusion. Right upper lobe opacity is slightly more conspicuous on the current study but that might be due to interval improvement in the right lower lobe opacity as overall improvement of the aeration of the right lung is noted. There is no pneumothorax.
