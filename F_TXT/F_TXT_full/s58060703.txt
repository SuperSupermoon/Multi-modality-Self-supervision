A radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessing the location of a nasogastric tube, which terminates within the stomach, with distal tip directed cephalad. This has either been advanced or replaced since the recent chest x-ray of earlier the same date. There are otherwise no relevant changes since the recent study except for worsening left retrocardiac opacity, likely due to a combination of atelectasis and adjacent pleural effusion.
