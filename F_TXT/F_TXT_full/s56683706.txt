There no prior chest radiographs available for review. Heterogeneous opacification in the right lower lobe was not present on the last prior chest imaging, a CT scan on ___. Since there was no pre procedure chest radiograph, I cannot tell if it predates the referenced biopsy, presumably of an endobronchial lesion in the left bronchial tree. It could be due to aspiration, particularly if there was hemoptysis associated with the biopsy, but there are no abnormalities in the left hemi thorax, either in the lung or pleural space, ipsilateral to the bronchoscopic biopsy.
