A single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest port which terminates in the mid SVC. Apparent increase in size of the heart may be secondary to portable supine technique. Right upper lobe and lower lobe opacities are consistent with lesion seen on recent CT chest. A retrocardiac opacity could be secondary to atelectatic change, but superimposed pneumonia can be considered. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
