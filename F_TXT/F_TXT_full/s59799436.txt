A frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right central catheter with the tip in the upper SVC and the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes in proper position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Bilateral layering pleural effusions are noted. Given the change in patient position, it is difficult to tell if these effusions are new or increased. The area of pneumonia is substantially covered by the layering fluid and difficult to evaluate. There is no pneumothorax.
