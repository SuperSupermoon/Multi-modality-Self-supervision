Small left pleural effusion again noted, similar to the prior study. There is probable atelectasis at the left base, similar to the prior study. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, though it is not clear how much of this is due to the diaphragm and high much due to the effusion. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is similar to the prior study.
