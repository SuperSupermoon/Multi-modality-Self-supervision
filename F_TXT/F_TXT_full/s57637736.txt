There has been interval placement of a dual lead pacemaker projecting over the left hemi thorax. The tip of the ventricular lead is not visualized on this study. A nasoenteric tube is in-situ, the tip is not visualized on this study. There is a persistent left pleural effusion, superior to have increased somewhat when compared to the prior study. The right pleural effusion is not well visualized on this study as the right costophrenic angle cannot be visualized. There is persistent silhouetting of both the right and left hemidiaphragms, likely due to atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded but appearances are really unchanged compared to multiple prior studies. No pneumothorax seen.
