As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially resulting from increased ventilatory pressure. There is unchanged evidence of bilateral basal opacities, with the morphology that rather suggest of atelectasis than pneumonia. However, both opacities show visible air bronchograms. The opacity on the right has minimally increased in extent. The opacity on the left is constant. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions.
