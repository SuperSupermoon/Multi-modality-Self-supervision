Endotracheal tube is at the level of the carina directed towards the right main bronchus as discussed by phone with Dr. ___ at noon on ___. Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with persistent rounded contour in left mediastinal and hilar regions, possibly due to enlarged central pulmonary arteries, but it is difficult to exclude a mass in this region on this portable radiograph. New patchy and linear right upper lobe atelectasis is present as well as partial atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
