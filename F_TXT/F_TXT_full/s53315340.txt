There is a feeding tube with a weighted tip that terminates in the stomach. To gain better purchase, if clinically indicated, the tube could be advanced somewhat further into the stomach. The heart is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions show layering but are probably unchanged. Associated opacity at the lung bases, greater on the left than right, is probably compatible with atelectasis. Particularly at the left lung base, however, it is difficult to exclude pneumonia. Correlation with pulmonary symptoms, if any, is recommended.
