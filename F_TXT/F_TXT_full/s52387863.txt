As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The lung volumes have minimally decreased, leading to an apparent increase in density of the pre-existing parenchymal opacity. Overall, these opacities, however, are unchanged in extent and severity. There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus so that the small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
