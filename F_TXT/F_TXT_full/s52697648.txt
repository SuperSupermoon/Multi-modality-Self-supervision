Right subclavian PICC line, tracheostomy tube, vascular stents are unchanged. There are layering bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar airspace disease, left greater the right tube which is also unchanged. Overlying the right mid clavicle is a more prominent soft tissue asymmetry which may represent an enlarging hematoma or be related to the recent reconstructive surgery given differences in positioning. Clinical correlation is advised. The perihilar vasculature is slightly more prominent which raises the possibility of superimposed mild interstitial edema. Again, clinical correlation would be recommended. No pneumothorax.
