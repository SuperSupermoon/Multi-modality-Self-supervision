A left chest tube remains in place and there are stable postoperative changes, retrocardiac consolidation and multiple rib fractures in the left hemithorax. The right lung is grossly clear and well inflated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning between studies. Stents, surgical clips and retained contrast are again seen in the left upper quadrant. External pacing wires. No pneumothorax.
