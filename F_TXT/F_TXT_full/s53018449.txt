Single portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates new left perihilar opacities worrisome for pneumonia. The remainder of the left hemi thorax and right lung appear clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or evidence of pulmonary edema.
