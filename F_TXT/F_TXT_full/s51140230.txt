The patient is severely rotated on the current study, this limits assessment. The Swan-Ganz catheter appears broad-based similar in configuration and the ECMO catheter is unchanged in location. The endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the level the carina. A nasogastric tube terminates, likely in the stomach. No pneumothorax seen. Apparent hazy opacification of the left lung is likely due to patient positioning. Presumed hero graft in the right axilla.
