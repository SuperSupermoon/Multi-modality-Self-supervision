In comparison with the study of ___, the right hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, consistent with improving pleural effusion or possibly a manifestation of a more erect position of the patient. Little change in the opacification at the left base consistent with pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis. There is again mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure that appears improved since the previous study.
