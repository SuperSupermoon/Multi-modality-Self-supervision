Previous moderate cardiomegaly has improved, and there is no evidence of cardiac decompensation currently aside from a small right pleural effusion. Lungs are clear. Previous left pleural effusion is resolved. Central lymph node calcifications are chronic, most likely due to prior granulomatous infection, but there is no indication of active infection today.
