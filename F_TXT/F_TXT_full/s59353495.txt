Compared to the prior study there appears to been some interval improvement in the previously seen the layering left-sided pleural effusion. No definite right-sided effusion seen. A left-sided chest tube remains in-situ. An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are also unchanged in appearance. A Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged in position, this appears to be in the region of the pulmonary valve/ main pulmonary artery. The right lung appears grossly clear. A right internal jugular catheter is unchanged in appearance. No pneumothorax seen.
