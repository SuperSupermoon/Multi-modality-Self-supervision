There are low lung volumes. This accentuates the cardiac silhouette size which is likely within normal limits. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion noted. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Streaky opacities within the lung bases bilaterally likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
