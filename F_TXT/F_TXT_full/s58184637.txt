Large dual-lumen left-sided central venous catheter is seen terminating at the cavoatrial junction/right atrium. There are relatively low lung volumes. Left base opacity may relate to atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. Additionally, there a couple subtle small patchy opacities in the right mid-to-lower lung and infectious process is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen; however, trace pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is mild prominence of the main pulmonary artery. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Partially imaged right humeral prosthesis is noted.
