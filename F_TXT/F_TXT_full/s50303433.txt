As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube is in unchanged position. There is no evidence of pneumothorax but the diffuse parenchymal opacities on the right have not changed. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise no abnormalities are noted in the left lung. Better visualized than on the previous examination are air collections in the left and right cervical soft tissues.
