Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier. If any, there is small left pleural effusion. Evaluation of small pneumothorax on the left is limited by the presence of left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. Left apical system remains in place. There are no other interval changes with multiple tiny lung nodules on the right lung. Cardio mediastinum is stable.
