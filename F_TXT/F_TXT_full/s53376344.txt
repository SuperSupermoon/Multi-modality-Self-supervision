As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The alignment of the sternal wires, the position of the left PICC line and the right hemodialysis catheter are unchanged. Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Improving atelectasis at the right lung bases. No overt pulmonary edema. No focal parenchymal opacities.
