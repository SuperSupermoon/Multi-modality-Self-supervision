Compared to ___ radiograph, bilateral chest tubes remain in place. Questionable small left apical pneumothorax is difficult to confirm due to patient rotation and external overlying devices in this region. Repeat nonrotated radiograph with repositioning of such structures would be helpful. Note is also made of new pulmonary vascular congestion, an apparent small right pleural effusion and adjacent right basilar atelectasis.
