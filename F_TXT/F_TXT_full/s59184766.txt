There is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax in this patient status post left pneumonectomy. The right lung remains well inflated and clear. No pulmonary edema. A right internal jugular Port-A-Cath remains in place. Given the pneumonectomy, it is difficult to evaluate the cardiac and mediastinal contours. Residual left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. No obvious pneumothorax.
