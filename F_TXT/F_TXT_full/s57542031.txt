Single portable frontal chest radiograph was performed. An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, 4 cm above the carina. A left pectoral dual lead pacemaker is unremarkable. There are bilateral perihilar opacities with prominence of the pulmonary interstitium, consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema. There is no definite pleural effusion. The heart size is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. Consolidation posterior to the cardiac silhouette is presumably atelectasis, although, aspiration would be difficult to exclude.
