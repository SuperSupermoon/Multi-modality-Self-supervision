There is diffuse bilateral interstitial abnormality with a suggestion of some peribronchial cuffing. Therefore, these findings are most consistent with mild interstitial edema rather than underlying interstitial lung disease or an atypical infection. Clinical correlation is recommended. No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. The heart is enlarged most likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. The apices are obscured by the patient's mandible but no obvious pneumothorax is seen. No large pleural effusions are evident.
