A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a central catheter with the tip in the low SVC/cavoatrial junction, multiple sternal wires, a valvular prosthesis, and surgical hardware. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema. No focal consolidation is definitely seen, although the lower lungs are difficult to evaluate secondary to bibasilar atelectasis and left greater than right small pleural effusions, unchanged from the prior study. There is no pneumothorax.
