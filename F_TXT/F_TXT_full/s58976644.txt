1. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There continues to be a diffuse bilateral predominantly interstitial abnormality in the lungs with more focal vague opacity in the left upper peripheral lung.

Therefore, these findings favor persistent interstitial edema rather than an infectious process. Clinical correlation would be advised. There is a small layering left effusion. There is overall improved aeration at the right base when compared to more remote studies. Heart remains enlarged. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No pneumothorax.
