AP chest compared to ___: Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 47 mm from the carina. It should be advanced 15 mm for more secure seating. Left pleural effusion has effectively cleared and basal pneumothorax is minimal if any, with two left apical and a basal thoracostomy tube in place. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is probably increasing. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Pulmonary edema is mild, and unchanged. Left internal jugular line ends in the mid-to-low SVC. No right pneumothorax.
