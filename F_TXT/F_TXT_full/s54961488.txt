Single portable frontal upright chest radiographs demonstrate stable enlargement of the heart and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Prominent bilateral interstitial markings, likely related to the patients history of sarcoidosis, is unchanged on the left; however, there is increased hazy opacification of the right base on top of persistent blunting of the costophrenic angle which could represent a layering effusion, but an underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
