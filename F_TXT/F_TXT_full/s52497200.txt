As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Slightly lower lung volumes, the peritoneal shunt, the left PICC line and the tracheostomy tube are in constant position. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with relatively extensive left lower lobe atelectasis. There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Right basal atelectasis is again noted.
