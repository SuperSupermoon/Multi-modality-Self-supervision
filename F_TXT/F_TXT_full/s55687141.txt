Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a Swan-Ganz catheter with distal tip is at the main pulmonary outflow tract. There is an intra-aortic balloon pump whose distal tip is in the aortic knob. This could be pulled back approximately 1 cm for more optimal placement. The heart size is enlarged. Lungs are clear. There are again seen calcifications within the lateral aspect of the left heart. No pneumothoraces are seen. There is an unchanged left-sided AICD generator.
