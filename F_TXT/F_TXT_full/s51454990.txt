In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ sheath has been removed. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists in this patient with intact midline sternal wires. There is continued hazy opacification bilaterally, more prominent on the left, with preservation of pulmonary markings consistent with bilateral layering pleural effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis. This appears to be increasingly prominent on the left, though this could merely reflect differences in patient position. In view of the prominent bilateral effusions, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would be extremely difficult to exclude.
