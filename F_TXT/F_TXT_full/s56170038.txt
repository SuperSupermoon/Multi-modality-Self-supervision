The previously seen layering right pleural effusion has increased, now large and causing adjacent compressive atelectasis and mild leftward midline shift. There may be a small left pleural effusion, incompletely evaluated on this single AP radiograph. The mediastinal contour is difficult to evaluate due to effusion, but is likely stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema are present. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
