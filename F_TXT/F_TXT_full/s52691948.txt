Mild cardiomegaly is increased accompanied by new pulmonary vascular congestion and a new moderate right pleural effusion. In the left hemi thorax there is a large peripheral opacity extending to the left major fissure. This could be a pleural fluid loculation or a lung lesion, including pneumonia or lung abscess. There is no pneumothorax. Left subclavian line ends in the low SVC. Mild leftward deviation of the trachea at just above the thoracic outlet could be due to an enlarged right thyroid lobe.
