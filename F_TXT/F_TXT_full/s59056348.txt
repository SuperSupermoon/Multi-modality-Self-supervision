Rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. Left IJ central line is present, tip probably overlying the proximal SVC. Heart size is borderline. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Small rounded densities projecting over the right hilum most likely represent vessels seen on end; calcified nodes are a less likely consideration. There is no CHF. The right lung is grossly clear, without consolidation or effusion. Compared to the CXR from ___ at 4:28 a.m. and allowing for differences in technique, there has been slight interval improvement in the atelectasis and/or left effusion. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been converted to a central line. If an NG tube is present, it is not well visualized, but some tubing is noted over the left upper quadrant. Additional EKG leads overlie the chest.
