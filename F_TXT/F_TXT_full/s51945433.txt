Portable AP images of the chest. The right PICC terminates in the distal SVC. An NG tube is seen in the stomach. The lungs are well expanded. Coarse linear opacity is seen in the lung bases, which likely represents atelectasis but could also represent aspiration in the right clinical setting. Lungs otherwise no pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior exam.
