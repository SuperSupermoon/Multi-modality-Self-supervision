CHEST, TWO VIEWS. Compared with ___, at 22:14 p.m., an ET tube has been placed. The tip of the tube lies approximately 2.2 cm above the carina, in satisfactory position. A nasogastric-type tube is also in place, with tip lying beneath the diaphragms at the expected site of the gastric body. The sideport position is difficult to assess due to the patient's anatomy. As before, there is marked cardiomegaly. There is actually improved appearance of the left main stem bronchus truncation. There is again diffuse opacity of much of the left lung, with some improved aeration at left lung apex, possibly due to change in position versus improvement in a left effusion. Compared to the prior study, there is new increased opacity in the right upper and mid zones in addition to the previously seen opacity at the right base. This could represent worsening of asymmetric edema or of infectious infiltrate and appears to also include an increase in a right-sided effusion. There is an unusual overlapped appearance to the fourth rib laterally, equivocal for a non-displaced fracture. IMPRESSION: 1. Lines and tubes as described. 2. Marked cardiomegaly, similar to prior. 3. Increased opacity right lung, ? worse asymmetric pulmonary edema or worsening infiltrate, together with increase in size of right effusion. 4. Improved aeration at the left lung apex, question improvement or repositioning of left effusion. 5. Double contour of the left fourth rib laterally, question artifact versus non-displaced fracture. Attention to this area on followup films is recommended.
