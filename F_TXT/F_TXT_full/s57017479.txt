As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right pleural pigtail catheter. This catheter has almost completely drained the pre-existing right pleural effusion. There is no visible pneumothorax. The lung volumes remain low. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Moderate left pleural effusion with subsequent atelectasis is unchanged as compared to the previous image.
