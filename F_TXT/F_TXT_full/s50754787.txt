Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal brachiocephalic near the junction with the SVC. A right internal jugular large bore catheter unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stably enlarged. Lung volumes are diminished. Interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema. No large effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Patchy opacity at the right medial lung base likely reflects atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
