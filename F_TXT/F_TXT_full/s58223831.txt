The patient has a tracheostomy. A new PICC line terminates in the lower superior vena cava. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours open are probably unchanged although the cardiac contour is partly obscured by a new moderate left-sided pleural effusion with probable opacification of portions of the left lower lobe and lingula. More superiorly the left lung remains clear. The right lung also remains clear. There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right side.
