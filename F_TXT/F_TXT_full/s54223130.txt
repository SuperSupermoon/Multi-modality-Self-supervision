Single portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube seen with tip approximately 3 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube seen with tip likely at the gastric body. Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam. Streaky right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis. There are additional areas of consolidation in he left upper lung as well. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged given differences in positioning and technique. Osseous and soft tissue structures are notable for calcific densities projecting over breast shadows bilaterally.
