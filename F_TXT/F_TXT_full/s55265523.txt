The lungs are well expanded. An ill-defined opacity is seen in the right lower lobe. Loss of the vascular markings in the retrocardiac space suggest a mild consolidation in this location as well. Mild cardiomegaly is present with associated upper vascular redistribution and mild hilar engorgement. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
