AP chest compared to 12:40 p.m. The patient positioning differs from the earlier study, and may account in part for apparent increase in moderate right pleural effusion and small change in the height of the apical visceral pleura denoting the size of the apical component of the left pneumothorax. It is now at the lower margin of the fourth posterior rib, previously at the level of the third posterior interspace. Basal and medial components of pleural air are comparable. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Lungs are grossly clear. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 1:50 p.m.
