Portable supine chest radiograph is obtained. Density projecting over the left chest is compatible with a bullet fragment. Humeral fracture is incompletely assessed. Keys project over the right lower hemithorax. The lungs otherwise appear well expanded without pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal consolidation. The heart and mediastinum is unremarkable.
