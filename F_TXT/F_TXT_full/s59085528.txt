1. The left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid SVC. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to marked patient rotation on the current study as well as an increasing left basilar airspace process. Given the focality of this finding, this either reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of layering effusion or aspiration/pneumonia. Asymmetric pulmonary edema in the setting of underlying emphysema could also have this appearance. Clinical correlation is advised. Smaller layering right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. The patient's mandible obscures the lung apices. Calcification in aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
