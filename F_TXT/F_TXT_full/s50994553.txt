There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with interval decrease in left pleural effusion. Lung volumes remain low and right base opacity persists but is less conspicuous. There is subtle evidence of bilateral pulmonary pulmonary nodules/cavitary lesions, better assessed on prior CT. Left base opacity may be due to combination of small pleural effusion, atelectasis and pneumonia. The left hemidiaphragm may be mildly elevated. No pneumothorax is seen.
