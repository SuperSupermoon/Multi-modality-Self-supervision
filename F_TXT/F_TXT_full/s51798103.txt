As compared to the previous radiograph, combination of parenchymal opacities and mild pulmonary edema is overall stable. At this stable level, the opacities are overall extensive. There is no evidence of larger pleural effusions. Moderate normal size of the cardiac silhouette. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged, including the relatively low positioned endotracheal tube, with the tip projecting 1.9 cm above the carina.
