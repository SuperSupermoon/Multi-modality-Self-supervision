1. Moderate-sized layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. No pulmonary edema. Heart remains enlarged, which may represent cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Right subclavian central line, nasogastric tube, left subclavian central line and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not visualized on the current study. No large pneumothorax, although sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished on the supine radiograph.
