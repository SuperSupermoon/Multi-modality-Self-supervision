A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Lung volumes are low, with bronchovascular crowding. Streaky opacity in the right base likely represents atelectasis. There is no definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. Rightward curvature of the thoracic spine is again seen and grossly unchanged.
