An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating at the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is in place with the tip terminating at the mid-to-lower SVC. The inspiratory lung volumes are low. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is accentuated due to low lung volumes. There is apparent widening of the mediastinum, which is due in part to unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Minimal calcification of the aortic knob is noted. The lungs are clear without large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is seen.
