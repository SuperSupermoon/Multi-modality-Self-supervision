No previous images. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes which accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart and the superior mediastinum. Hazy opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with layering left pleural effusion and substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. No substantial vascular congestion.
