Single portable view of the chest. No prior. The lungs are clear of focal consolidation. Linear opacity at left lung base suggestive of atelectasis. Nodular opacity projects over the anterior left first rib, potentially within it or in the left lung apex. Lungs are otherwise clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue structures are grossly unremarkable.
