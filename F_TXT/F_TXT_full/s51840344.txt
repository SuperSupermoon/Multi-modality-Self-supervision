The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature. New retrocardiac opacity causing obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is noted. Stable small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Top-normal heart size is accentuated due to low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Mild prominence of the right hilus is most likely due to patient rotation and superimposed atelectasis and scarring.
