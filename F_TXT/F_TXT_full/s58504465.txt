Right PICC terminates in the mid to lower superior vena cava. Removal of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. Bilateral upper lobe bulla, marked upper lobe volume loss, and areas of parenchymal scarring and architectural distortion appear similar. Heterogeneous opacities in the mid and lower lungs have slightly worsened, however, and small pleural effusions are again demonstrated, left greater than right.
