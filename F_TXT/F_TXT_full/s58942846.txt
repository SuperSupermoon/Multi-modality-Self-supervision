There is stable mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. Bibasilar air space opacities are now noted with at least an associated left effusion and likely a smaller right effusion. These findings may be related to pulmonary edema, but also could reflect a partial lower lobe atelectasis or superimposed pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Left subclavian PICC line is seen with its tip in the distal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing to at least the distal esophagus with the tip not definitely identified. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in positioning.
