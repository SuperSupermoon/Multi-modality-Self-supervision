In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is an endotracheal tube in place with the tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Opacification at the right base is again consistent with pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis. The hazy opacification on the left has substantially decreased. This may reflect change in patient position with re-distribution of previously described effusion. There is a substantial amount of intraperitoneal gas. Presumably related to the recent PEG insertion, though the substantial amount of gas has been conveyed to Dr. ___.
