Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, with side-port in the proximal stomach and tip beyond the field of view of the radiograph. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by minimal edema. Right hemidiaphragm has an unusual contour possibly due to eventration or a peridiaphragmatic process such as pleural effusion. It is difficult to assess for free intraperitoneal air due to supine positioning of the patient.
