Comparison with prior studies is severely limited by patient positioning. Allowing for these differences in technique, there may be a small left pleural effusion and increasing retrocardiac atelectasis. The mediastinum is probably unchanged. Repeat radiographs with standard positioning are recommended when clinically indicated. The endotracheal tube ends 1.8 cm from the carina. The right IJ CVC ends at the cavoatrial junction. The enteric tube ends within the decompressed stomach. ___ midline drains and a right pleural drain are in unchanged position. Dual chamber pacemaker leads projecting unchanged standard position. There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.
