AP chest compared to ___: Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Heterogeneous opacification in the left lung may have improved, but the apparent change could also be due to improved lung volumes, since this is barely a day later. Right lung volume is quite low due to chronically elevated right hemidiaphragm, but there is a suggestion of small foci of infection on the right as well. Pleural effusions are small if any. If the presumed pneumonia fails to clear, I would perform a chest CT scan to make sure we are not dealing with lung nodules.
