CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. ET tube and NG tube in satisfactory position. Bilateral chest tubes present. As before, the right-sided chest tube side port overlies the lateral edge of the chest wall. Allowing for technical differences, the cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary parenchymal findings are similar. However, the left hemidiaphragm is not well visualized, likely reflecting a combination of some increased left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and possibly a small amount of left pleural fluid. No pneumothorax detected.
