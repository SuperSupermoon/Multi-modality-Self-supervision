Midline drain and right chest tube remain in place, with persistent small left apical pneumothorax and a small to moderate right apical lateral pneumothorax, both slightly improved since the recent chest x-ray. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Although left lower lobe atelectasis has improved, there is worsening opacity at the right lung base, probably a combination of atelectasis and adjacent small right pleural effusion. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
