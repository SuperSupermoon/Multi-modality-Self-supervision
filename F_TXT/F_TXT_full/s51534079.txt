Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bilateral atelectasis. Allowing for this there is likely mild central pulmonary vascular congestion, similar to the prior study without overt pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. A right PICC terminates in the low SVC. A 3 mm right lower lung nodule corresponds to a granuloma seen on recent chest CT.
