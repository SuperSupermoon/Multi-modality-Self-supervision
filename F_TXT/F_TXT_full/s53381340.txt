1. Interval removal of nasogastric tube. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The mandible obscures the right apex. Lung volumes remain low. There are streaky retrocardiac opacities, which may reflect areas of atelectasis. There has been interval appearance of a 2.5 cm nodular opacity at the right lung base, which could reflect focal infectious process, focal infarct/hemorrhage, or loculated fluid. Clinical correlation is advised and followup imaging should be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
