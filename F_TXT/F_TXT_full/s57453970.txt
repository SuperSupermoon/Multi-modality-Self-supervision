Bilateral increased interstitial markings in the lower lungs are demonstrated but may reflect underlying emphysema. Retrocardiac opacity with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm border could reflect edema, atelectasis or consolidation/ pneumonia. A nodular opacity projecting over the left lung apex likely represents a chronic rib deformity. No large pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Perihilar asymmetric opacities in the left lung could also represent foci of infection.
