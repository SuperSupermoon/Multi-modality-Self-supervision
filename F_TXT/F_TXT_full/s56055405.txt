There is increased opacity at the right lung base. Some of this could be due to elevation of the right hemidiaphragm although subpulmonic effusion is possible. Patchy adjacent consolidation is also noted. Left lung is grossly clear noting motion which obscures fine detail. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
