Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There are lower lung volumes. There is apparent increase in size of the cardiac silhouette. This could be just a combination of lower lung volumes and technique. There are worsening bibasilar opacities consistent with worsening atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There is new mild vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
