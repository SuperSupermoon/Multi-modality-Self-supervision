Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Left internal jugular central venous catheter is seen terminating at the brachiocephalic/SVC confluence without evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged. Perihilar opacities suggest pulmonary edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
