Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 5 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. The lungs are grossly clear. No definite focal consolidation is seen. Subtle streaky left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis, although an early aspiration is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
