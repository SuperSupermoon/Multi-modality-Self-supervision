As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone right thoracocentesis. The right drain is in unchanged position. A zone of pleural thickening and of minimal remnant effusion persists. Mild atelectasis at the right lung bases. No convincing evidence for the presence of a right pneumothorax. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged appearance of the left lung. A hyperlucent line paralleling the left chest wall is caused by a skinfold and should not be mistaken for pneumothorax.
