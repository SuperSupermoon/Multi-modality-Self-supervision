As compared to ___, the pre-existing opacity at the right lung base is minimally increasing in extent. Given these increase, either increasing atelectasis or developing pneumonia must be considered as a differential diagnosis. Otherwise, no relevant change is seen. The tracheal and bronchial stents are better visualized than on the previous image. The right pigtail catheter is in unchanged position. There is a millimetric right apical and right basal pneumothorax. No evidence of tension. Otherwise no relevant change.
