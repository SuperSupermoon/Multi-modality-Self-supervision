The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is similar mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Hazy opacity projecting along the left lateral lung base appears increased with a new indistinct margin to the left lateral cardiac border suggesting a lingular opacity. Pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.
