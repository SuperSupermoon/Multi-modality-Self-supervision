As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the partly loculated pleural effusions has increased. This is visible both in the fissural aspect of the pre-existing effusion as well as on the apical lateral compartment along the right chest wall. Unchanged evidence of moderate pulmonary edema with associated moderate cardiomegaly. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged position of the left pectoral pacemaker, unchanged course of the leads.
