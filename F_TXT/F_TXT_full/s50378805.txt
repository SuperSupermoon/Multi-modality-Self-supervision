Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from earlier the same day at 7:03 p.m. Endotracheal tube is now seen with tip approximately 3 cm from the carina. Enteric tube is seen with tip below the diaphragm with side port likely just past the GE junction. Again low lung volumes are seen as well as left base opacity. Right-sided PICC again noted; however, tip as on prior is not clearly delineated on the current exam due to motion.
