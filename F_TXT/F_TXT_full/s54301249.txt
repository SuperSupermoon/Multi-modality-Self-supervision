Interval removal of the endotracheal tube, mediastinal drains, and nasogastric tube. Right internal jugular central line and left basilar chest tube remain in place. Patchy opacity at the left base with associated effusion likely reflects compressive atelectasis in this patient status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Left hemidiaphragm remains slightly elevated, possibly related to mild gastric distension on the current study. No pneumothorax identified.
