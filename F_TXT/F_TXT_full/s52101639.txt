1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 5 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. The orogastric tube is seen down to the level of the carina and the tip is not clearly seen, although there is a curvilinear opacity in the region of the stomach. Follow-up imaging after advancement would be advised. Lung volumes remain low with patchy bibasilar opacities most likely reflecting bibasilar atelectasis, although aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning.
