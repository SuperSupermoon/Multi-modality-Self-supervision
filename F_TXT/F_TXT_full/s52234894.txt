Relatively low lung volumes noted with crowding of the bronchovascular markings. There is no overt pulmonary edema. There is streaky right basilar opacity with more focal consolidation at the left lung base in the retrocardiac region. There is no pneumothorax nor pleural effusion, although the extreme costophrenic angles are excluded from the field of view. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
