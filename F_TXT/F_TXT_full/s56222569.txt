Endotracheal tube terminates 2.7 cm above the carina, likely related to changes in chin positioning. Right IJ venous catheter and enteric tube are in unchanged position. Lower lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular structures. There is mild vascular engorgement and early pulmonary edema. No definite pneumonia or pleural effusions identified. An ossific density is again seen over the right acromion and distal right clavicle.
