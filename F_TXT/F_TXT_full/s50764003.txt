Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion, now moderate-to-large, with associated worsening atelectasis in the right lung. The effusion remains loculated, and note is made of marked pleural thickening along the mediastinal pleural surface, more fully evaluated on CT of ___, along with adjacent mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Left lung and pleural surfaces are grossly clear when allowances are made for crowding of bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes.
