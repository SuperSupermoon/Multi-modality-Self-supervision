As compared to the previous radiograph, the image shows unchanged overinflation and loss of lung structure in the upper lobes. There currently is no evidence of a focal low diffuse parenchymal opacity that could be suggestive of inflammatory disease. The hilar and mediastinal structures are unremarkable. The size of the cardiac silhouette is within normal borders. No pneumothorax.
