Right PIC line has been partially withdrawn, but still heads into the right internal jugular vein no less than 6 cm beyond its junction with the right subclavian vein. Interstitial abnormality in the right lung and left lower lobe is improving, probably due to decreasing edema. Concurrent pneumonia should be considered, particularly in the left lower lobe. The abnormality in the right lung could be due to progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Heart size normal. Pleural effusion small on the left if any. Right jugular line ends at the level of the superior cavoatrial junction.
