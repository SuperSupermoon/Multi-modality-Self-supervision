There is streaky density bilaterally consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. Density in the lower left mid lung is somewhat increased and superimposed focal consolidation cannot be excluded but is unlikely. The left hemidiaphragm appears elevated as before. The heart appears large. The aorta is calcified. Mediastinal structures are stable. A right PICC now terminates in the region cavoatrial junction. There is no other significant change.
