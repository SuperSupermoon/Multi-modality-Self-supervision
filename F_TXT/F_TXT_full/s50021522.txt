There is a left chest tube, which appears unchanged in comparison to the prior chest radiograph. There is a small residual left apical pneumothorax, which is also unchanged. There is rounded opacity in the left mid lung likely atelectasis, and there is veil like opacity over the left lung which is likely layering left pleural effusion. The small right pleural effusion has increased and increasing opacity in the right lower lobe, likely worsening atelectasis. Heart size is stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The pulmonary vasculature is not significantly enlarged.
