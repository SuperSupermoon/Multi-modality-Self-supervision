There continue to be layering bilateral effusions with increasing consolidation, particularly at the left base which could reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis. Overall, the bilateral air space process appears to have slightly worsened which could reflect worsening infection or pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No large pneumothorax. Left subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube are unchanged.
