In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, the extent of right lung atelectasis has improved, with re-expansion of the right upper lobe. There remains near complete collapse of the right middle and lower lobes, likely due to mucous plugging in the bronchus intermedius. Nonspecific left basilar opacity has worsened in the interval. No other relevant change.
