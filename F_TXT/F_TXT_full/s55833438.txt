An endotracheal tube terminates 1.9 cm from the carina with distension of the mid trachea suggesting mild hyperinflation of endotracheal tube balloon. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm outside of the field of view. A coronary stent projects heart. Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion is associated with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Left retrocardiac opacification likely represents a combination of effusion and compressive atelectasis. A faint nodular opacity in the left upper lung adjacent to a rounded structure external to the patient is likely due to overlapping densities of the ribs at this level. Attention on followup is recommended. There is no pneumothorax. The osseous structures and upper abdomen are unremarkable. Dense calcification of the aortic arch is noted.
