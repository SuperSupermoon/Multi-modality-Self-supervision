The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 3.7 cm above the level of the carina. A right PICC ends in the mid SVC, unchanged. An enteric catheter passes below the level of the diaphragm, ending in the mid stomach. The sidehole is slightly below the expected level of the gastroesophageal junction. There are widespread bilateral opacities, more severe at the lung bases, overall similar to the most recent radiograph from ___, aside from in the left mid to lower lung where the opacities have increased. There are no definite pleural effusions. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
