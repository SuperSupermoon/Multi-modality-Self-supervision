Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Several sternal wires are fractured including the superior to inferior rows as well as the second inferior more wire. There is increased reticulonodular opacity at the lung bases bilaterally, which could be due to aspiration or possibly infection. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
