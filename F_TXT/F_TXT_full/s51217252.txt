Lung volumes remain slightly low. Streak like opacities in the right mid lung and a left lower lung likely reflect atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity and opacity of the left costophrenic angle may reflect volume loss and atelectasis; however, it appears slightly increased from the prior exam and concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical situation. No pneumothorax. Small left greater than right pleural effusions persist. Widened mediastinum and heart size secondary to ascending and descending thoracic aorta aneurysm and dissection are better assessed on the prior CT and appears similar on radiograph to the prior exam. Median sternotomy wires and surgical clips in the mediastinum as well as projecting over the right axilla are overall unchanged.
