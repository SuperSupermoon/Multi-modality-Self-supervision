In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 5 cm above the carina and the nasogastric tube extends into the stomach, with the side hole just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Low lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of the pulmonary vessels, though some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure should be considered. Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
