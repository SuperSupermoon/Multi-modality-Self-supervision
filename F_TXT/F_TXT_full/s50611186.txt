An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, terminating approximately 6 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube courses through the esophagus, below the diaphragm and out of view. The lungs are well-expanded. There is indistinctness of the hilar structures and peribronchial cuffing. Hazy opacities are present in the bilateral lower lungs. The heart is top-normal in size. Mediastinal vascular clips and chain sutures in the left apex are related to prior wedge resection, along with a rounded opacity in the left upper lobe.
