ICD pacing device is in place with leads terminating in the regions of the right atrium and right ventricle. Heart is upper limits of normal in size, and the aorta is tortuous. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. Coarse reticular opacities are present at the right lung base and raise the concern for chronic scarring or fibrosis in this region. Left base is not well visualized due to slight rotation of the patient and overlying cardiac structures. No confluent areas of consolidation are evident to suggest the presence of pneumonia. Healed right rib fractures are incidentally noted.
