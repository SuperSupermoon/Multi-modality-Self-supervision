A vascular stent is seen in the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC, unchanged in appearance from the prior examination. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Subtle opacities seen throughout both lungs, most notable at the base of the right lung obscuring the right heart border, are suggestive of multifocal infection. An area of focal opacity projected over the left mid lung could represent an additional area of consolidation. In addition, there is increased vascular congestion, that should be -re-assessed after diuresis. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
