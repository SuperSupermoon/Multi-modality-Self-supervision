Comparison is made with prior study ___. There is no evident pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There are low lung volumes. Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Bibasilar atelectases, larger on the right side, are stable. Calcified granulomas in the right upper lobe are again noted. Ill-defined rounded opacity in the left upper lobe is persistent. When clinically feasible CT is recommended for further evaluation.
