A left central line terminates in the proximal right atrium. The ET tube terminates approximately 8.5 cm above the carina and could be advanced 4 cm for more optimal position. A right Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC. A feeding tube terminates in the stomach. There are low lung volumes. Alveolar opacities are seen diffusely through the bilateral lungs, along with cardiomegaly, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusions likely present. No pneumothorax seen.
