The tip of the right subclavian PICC line is in the mid portion of the SVC. When compared to the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The right heart border is now sharply seen, as is the hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial decrease in pleural effusion. However, this could represent a more erect position of the patient rather than significant fluid decrease. There is opacification at the left base consistent with a small effusion on this side.
