Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by the projection. Widened mediastinum is stable. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Right supraclavicular catheter tip is in the mid SVC. The extensive bilateral lung opacities, right greater than left, have worsened, consistent with worsening diffuse pneumonia. Of note, the opacities also could be due to a component of worsening moderate pulmonary edema. Small-to-moderate right effusion and small left effusion are new or newly apparent. Sternal wires are aligned.
