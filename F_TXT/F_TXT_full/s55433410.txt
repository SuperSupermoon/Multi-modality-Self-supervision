A portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left PICC which appears to terminate in the upper right atrium, although this may be related to low lung volumes. If desired, this can be pulled back approximately 2.0 cm to terminate in the low SVC. The remainder of the exam is largely unchanged, with slightly lower lung volumes resulting in increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
