Mild pulmonary edema is nearly resolved. Persistent consolidative abnormalities at the lung bases could be retained edema, or atelectasis, but should be followed to exclude pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusion is presumed. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax. Incidental note is made of severe degeneration of the left shoulder, and atherosclerotic calcification in tortuous head and neck vessels.
