Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a NG tube in the neoesophagus ending just above the suture line. 2 drains are noted projecting over the mediastinum. Widening of the mediastinum is likely related to neoesophagus and recent surgery. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted in the bilateral chest wall. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
