The ET tube lies 3.8 cm above the carinal. Right IJ line tip overlies distal SVC near SVC/RA junction. An orogastric tube is present with tip extending beneath the diaphragm and off the film. Inspiratory volumes are quite low, with relative elevation the right hemidiaphragm. The degree of vascular plethora, which itself is likely accentuated by low lung volumes, may be slightly worse. Otherwise, the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and lungs is similar to the prior film. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is bibasilar atelectasis, likely also accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. No gross left effusion. No obvious right effusion. Allowing for low lung volumes, no focal consolidation identified.
