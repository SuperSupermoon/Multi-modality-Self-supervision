The endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. The left PICC line terminates in the right atrium, and if desired, would need to be withdrawn at least 3.5 cm to be positioned in the low SVC. No pneumothorax. There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, obscuring the heart borders. The right effusion may be loculated, as fluid is not distributed diffusely and posteriorly and lung on this supine view. Substantial left lower lobe atelectasis with leftward shift of the mediastinum is unchanged.
