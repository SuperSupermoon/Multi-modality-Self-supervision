As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increased in general lung density, likely to reflect pulmonary edema after cardiac failure. Presence of a small pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is evidence of retrocardiac atelectasis. The patient has been intubated, the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the carina with its tip. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other complication.
