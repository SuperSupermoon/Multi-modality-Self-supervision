Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of a left-sided pigtail catheter with interval decrease in left-sided pneumothorax which is no longer well evident. Left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is seen. The left lung is better expanded, although overall there are low lung volumes symmetrically bilaterally. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is streaky left basilar opacity, most likely atelectasis rather than pulmonary consolidation. No definite fracture is identified.
