Portable AP view of the chest. Relatively low lung volumes are seen compared to prior. There are bibasilar opacities with more dense consolidation identified in the retrocardiac region which silhouettes the descending thoracic aorta and medial hemidiaphragm. Superiorly the lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged given differences in positioning and technique. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
