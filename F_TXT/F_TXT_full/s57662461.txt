There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which terminates above the carina. An enteric tube courses below the hemidiaphragm to enter the stomach, but its tip is not visualized. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis are unchanged. The heart and mediastinum cannot be accurately assessed on this projection. The patient is status post median sternotomy with valve replacement. There is no pneumothorax.
