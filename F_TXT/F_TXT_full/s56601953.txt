Please also see findings on a chest CT dated ___. The distal portion of a tracheostomy tube overlies the upper airway. The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. There is minimal atelectasis or scarring at both lung bases. No effusions are identified. Compared with ___, inspiratory volumes are better and the patchy opacity at the left base and vague opacities along the right upper zone have improved. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. At the extreme edge of these films, deformity and loose bodies about the left glenohumeral joint are incidentally noted, not fully evaluated.
