The endotracheal tube sits 4 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube tip sits within the stomach, although a portion of the weighted tip sits above the GE junction. The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable. The lungs continue to demonstrate heterogeneous opacity in the right mid and lower portion, which may represent an area of scarring. Additionally, more scattered punctate densities throughout the right and left lung are compatible with calcified pleural plaques as confirmed by the visualized chest portion of the abdominal and pelvic CT from ___. Trace bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
