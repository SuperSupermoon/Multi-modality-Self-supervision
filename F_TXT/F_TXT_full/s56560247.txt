There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 5.1 cm above the level the carina. Enteric tube has also been placed, which appears to course below the level of the diaphragm, into the left upper quadrant, presumably within the stomach. There is now complete opacification of the left hemi thorax and shift of the mediastinum to the left, worrisome for extensive lung collapse ; underlying consolidation or small pleural effusion not excluded. The right lung is clear. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are not assessed as they are shifted to the left and obscured by the overlying left hemi thorax opacification.
