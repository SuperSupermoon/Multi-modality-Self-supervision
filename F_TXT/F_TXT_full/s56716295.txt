Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a marked increase in the left-sided pleural effusion, which now opacifies the entire left hemithorax. There is no shift of mediastinal structures away from the effusion, indicating considerable atelectasis/collapse of the underlying lung. This is confirmed by a blunt ending left main stem bronchus, which may be occluded. The small right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged. The right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. A tracheostomy tube is in place. A left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. An NG tube courses through the esophagus, into the stomach and inferiorly out of the field of view. Heart size is difficult to assess due to overlying effusion, but there is no pulmonary edema seen on the right.
