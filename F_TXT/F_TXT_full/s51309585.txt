AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened again. The relatively greater opacification at the right lung base seen previously was due to a combination of edema, atelectasis and right pleural effusion, so it is not necessary to invoke possible pneumonia to explain the current radiographic findings. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Pulmonary vascular engorgement and distention of mediastinal veins have worsened. No pneumothorax. Large calcified granulomas longstanding in the upper lungs.
