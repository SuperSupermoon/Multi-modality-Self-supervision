There is increasing opacity in the right mid and lower lung and a stable opacity in the left lung with associated cephalization of the vasculature. Given the rapidity of change, this would favor pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable given differences in positioning. Right internal jugular central line, esophageal probe, and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. Endotracheal tube now has its tip 3 cm above the carina.
