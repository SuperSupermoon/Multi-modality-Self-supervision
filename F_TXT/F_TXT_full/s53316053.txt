As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The right PICC line has been pulled back, the tip of the line now projects over the uppermost parts of the superior vena cava. An abdominal drain in the left upper quadrant is in unchanged position. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities at the lung bases have decreased in extent and severity but are still clearly visible. Also decreased are small pre-existing pleural effusions. The heart continues to be borderline in size, and the aorta is tortuous. Signs of minimal fluid overload could be present. No pneumothorax. Unchanged symmetrical apical thickening.
