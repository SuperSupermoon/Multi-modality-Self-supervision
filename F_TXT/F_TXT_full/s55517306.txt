Lung volumes are reduced. Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal contours are stable. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Assessment of the lung bases is limited due to poor inspiratory volumes, with a retrocardiac opacity possibly reflecting atelectasis. Infection or aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax is detected. Assessment for a pleural effusion is limited on these views as the left costophrenic angle is excluded.
