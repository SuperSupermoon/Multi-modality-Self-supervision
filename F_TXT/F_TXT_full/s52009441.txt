1. Lung volumes are slightly low with linear opacity at the left base likely representing scarring. Several calcified nodules in the left lung base likely reflect granulomas. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Right PICC line remains in place with its tip now in the proximal SVC. No pneumothorax although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished on the supine radiograph.
