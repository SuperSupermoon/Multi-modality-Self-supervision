Interval placement of a right pleural catheter with associated decrease in size of right pleural effusion, and no visible apical pneumothorax. A horizontal interface in the lower right hemithorax just medial to the site of the pleural catheter could reflect a loculated basilar hydropneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for differences in lung volumes. Bilateral pulmonary lung nodules are again visualized, in keeping with metastatic disease. Destructive right rib lesions are seen to better detail on recent CT.
