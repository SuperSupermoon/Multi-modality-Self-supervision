Interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the proximal SVC. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Patchy infrahilar right-sided opacity is felt to more likely reflect confluence of vascular structures given differences in positioning rather than an early infiltrate. Clinical correlation is advised and followup imaging should be based on the clinical assessment. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
