CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the diaphragm of film. A right IJ central line is present, tip overlying proximal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There is patchy opacity at the left base, with elevated left hemidiaphragm and possible small pleural effusion. No CHF. The right lung is grossly clear, without effusion. Compared with ___ at 15:57 p.m., the ET tube has been removed. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
