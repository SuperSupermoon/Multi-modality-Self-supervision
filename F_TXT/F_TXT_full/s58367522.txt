Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian PICC line remain unchanged in position. There is a left chest tube in place. A very tiny left apical pneumothorax is now seen which is smaller than that seen on the prior study of ___ at 16:23. There are small layering effusions with patchy bibasilar consolidation, left greater the right, most likely representing compressive lower lobe atelectasis.
