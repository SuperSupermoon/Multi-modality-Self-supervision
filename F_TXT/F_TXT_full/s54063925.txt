In comparison with the study of ___, there again is a minimal right apical pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. Continued opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural fluid. Smaller pleural effusion on the right with basilar atelectasis. Evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure persists.
