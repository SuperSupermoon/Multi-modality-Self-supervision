There is a larger bore pigtail catheter in the right chest than on the prior study, and small left pigtail catheter is again seen projecting over the left lower lung. There are some curvilinear opacities projecting over the right lower and mid lung. It is unclear if these represent some areas of pleura in a partially reexpanded lung but are not typical in appearance for pneumothorax. Recommend attention to this region on followup. There is a layering right effusion with air-fluid level. The effusion is smaller than on the prior study. The left lung is predominantly clear with small left effusion, similar in size compared to prior.
