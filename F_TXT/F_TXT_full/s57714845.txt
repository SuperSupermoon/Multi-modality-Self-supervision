Right internal jugular catheter has tip ending in upper SVC/origin of the SVC. Lung volume is moderate withbibasilar atelectasis, larger to left than to the right. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is probably due to small pleural effusion. Heart size is normal, with apparent enlargement of the vascular pedicle for mild pectus excavatum. There is no pneumothorax.
