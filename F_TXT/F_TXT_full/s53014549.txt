Comparison is made to prior study ___. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is new. Right lower lobe opacity has improved consistent with improving atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Opacity in the left apex and irregularity of the left upper ribs corresponds to mass seen in prior CT. Cardiomegaly is stable. Increasing opacity in the left lower lobe is consistent with increasing atelectasis and pleural effusion. Spinal hardware is again noted.
