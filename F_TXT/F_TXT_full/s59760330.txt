The lung volumes are low. Allowing for that, there is no definite change in cardiac, mediastinal or hilar contours. A right basilar opacity has probably cleared. However, mild new opacification is present at the left lung base partly obscuring the left hemidiaphragm. Small pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.
