Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contours are stable. There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature with evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure, similar in appearance compared to the prior study given differences in inspiration. Vasculature may be minimally more prominent as compared to the prior study, although improved compared to ___ and this may in part relate to lower lung volumes. Again, there is likely a trace right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax seen.
