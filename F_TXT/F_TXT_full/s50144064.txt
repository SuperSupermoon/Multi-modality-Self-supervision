AP chest compared to 6:17 p.m.: Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 7.5 cm above the carina and should be advanced no less than 4 cm. Subsequent chest radiograph showed standard repositioning. Severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening are longstanding. Atelectasis or consolidation at both lung bases is obscured by the cardiac silhouette on the left, moderately severe and possibly worsened on the right.
