AP chest compared to ___, 5:41 a.m. There is more consolidation at the base of the right lung, some of which is lower lobe atelectasis, but now may be supplemented by new consolidation in either lower or middle lobes, as well as increase in the small-to-moderate right pleural effusion. On the left, the apex of the left upper lobe is now partially aerated, perhaps due to reexpansion of previous atelectasis or redistribution of moderate-to-large left pleural effusion. Left lower lobe remains collapsed, explaining leftward mediastinal shift. No pneumothorax.
