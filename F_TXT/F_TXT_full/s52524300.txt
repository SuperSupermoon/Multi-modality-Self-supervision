As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 6 cm above the carina. The tube should be advanced by 1-2 cm. The lung volumes have slightly increased, likely caused by intubation and administration of positive pressure. The changes in the lung parenchyma are still highly suggestive of pulmonary edema, as discussed with the referring physician on occasion of the previous chest radiograph acquired at 4:10 on ___.
