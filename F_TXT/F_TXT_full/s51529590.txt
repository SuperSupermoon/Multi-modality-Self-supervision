Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Through the position of the bowel, lucency under the left hemidiaphragm could relate to colon and stomach, although it is difficult to exclude free air on this study. Recommend supine and upright views of the abdomen for further evaluation.
