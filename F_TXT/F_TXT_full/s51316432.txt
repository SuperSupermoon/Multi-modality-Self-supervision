CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Again seen is a moderate-sized right apical pneumothorax. Compared with ___ at 4:56 a.m., right apical pneumothorax appears larger. The right-sided chest tube is similar in configuration. There is increasing opacification of the partially collapsed right lung. The differential diagnosis includes atelectasis and changes related to re-expansion edema. Mediastinum remains midline and the left lung is grossly clear, with minimal basilar atelectasis and a small left effusion. No left-sided CHF.
