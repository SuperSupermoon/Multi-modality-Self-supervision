As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed. The patient has received a nasogastric tube which shows a normal course. The tip of the tube, however, is not visible on the image. There is no acute pulmonary edema. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and subsequent areas of right atelectasis. Mild left retrocardiac atelectasis. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus is unchanged, so that the presence of a minimal pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
