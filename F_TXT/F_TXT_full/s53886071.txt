Mild bibasilar atelectasis is seen. There is no definite focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There has been interval removal of previously seen right-sided PICC. Partially imaged hardware in the left humerus is not well assessed on this study.
