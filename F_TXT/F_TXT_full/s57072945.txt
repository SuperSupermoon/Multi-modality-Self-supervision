Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is present. Heart size is difficult to evaluate but appears mildly enlarged. The aorta is mildly tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Mild pulmonary edema is new since the previous chest radiograph. Confluent opacities are seen within the left mid lung field and left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia. Additional ill-defined nodular opacities are seen within the right lung compatible with small airways disease, better assessed on the previous CT. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. A gastric lap band is incompletely imaged.
