The feeding tube has its tip projecting over the stomach. A left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC. Given patient rotation, overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable but enlarged. Lungs appear grossly clear, although the retrocardiac region is difficult to assess due to patient rotation. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
