In comparison with previous study, the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed. There is some increased opacification at the left base, which could well represent merely atelectasis and small effusion. However, if there is strong clinical suspicion for an infectious process, this would be difficult to exclude in the absence of a lateral view. There may be mild atelectatic changes at the right base. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises the possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
