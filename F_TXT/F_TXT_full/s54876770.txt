A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a tracheostomy, nasogastric tube, a right PICC, and a right chest pigtail catheter, all of which are unchanged in position. The previously seen small right pneumothorax is now largely replaced by fluid at the apex. Heterogeneous consolidations of the right lung, upper lobe greater than lower lobe, are again seen and unchanged. There is atelectasis of the left lower lobe. The remainder of the exam is unchanged.
