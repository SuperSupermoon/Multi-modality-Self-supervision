As compared to ___ radiograph, bilateral asymmetrically distributed air space opacities have nearly resolved, and likely represented asymmetrical edema. Residual interstitial edema is noted as well as slightly more confluent opacities at the lung bases, which may reflect dependent edema and atelectasis. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
