AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Consolidation in the right lower lobe is extensive and unequivocal. There may be a smaller region of consolidation on the left, but pneumonia on the right is cleared. Heart is moderately enlarged, upper lobe vasculature mildly engorged, but free of pulmonary edema. Pleural effusions are small, if any.
