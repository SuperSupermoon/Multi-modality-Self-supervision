Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles, right greater than left, consistent with bilateral pleural effusions. Overlying atelectasis is seen. Additionally, there is an area of ill-defined opacity in the right mid lung which could be due to consolidation but the cardiac silhouette is difficult to optimally assess due to bilateral pleural effusion, appears top normal. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. No pneumothorax is seen.
