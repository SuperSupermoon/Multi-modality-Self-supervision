An ill-defined opacity is seen in the right perihilar region, with associated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and a small right-sided pleural effusion. Right basilar patchy opacity is identified. Otherwise, the left lung is well expanded without focal opacities. There is no left-sided pleural effusion. Cardiac size is normal. Thickening of the right paratracheal stripe likely indicates mediastinal lymphadenopathy. No pneumothorax is identified.
