Compared to the most recent prior film, Dobbhoff tube placement has been attempted. Allowing for slightly rotated positioning, the radiopaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube overlies the thoracic inlet/superior mediastinum. Because it does not pass distal to the carina, the Dobbhoff tube position in relation to the trachea cannot be confidently ascertained. Clinical correlation is therefore requested. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
