CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Lordotic positioning. Slight rotation. A Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip overlying the right pulmonary artery. Multiple electronic leads overlie the chest, similar to the prior film. This appearance is compatible with a transvenous pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and coronary sinus. There is upper zone re-distribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with mild CHF. This may be slightly improved. Again seen is moderately severe cardiomegaly. There is increased opacity at the left base, though the diaphragm remains visible -- ? accentuated by overlying soft tissues and underpenetration. If there is concern for a left lower lobe infiltrate, then a lateral view could help for further assessment. The extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film, but no gross left effusion is suggested. The right base is obscured by the electronic device, but no gross consolidation of the right lung is identified. No right effusion detected.
