In comparison with study of ___, the right IJ catheter appears to have been removed. Nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube remain in position. Bilateral pulmonary opacification is again seen, presumably related to some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure and possible layering effusions. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
