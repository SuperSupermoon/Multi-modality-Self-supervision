Persistent tiny right apical pneumothorax. Stable cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion. Newly developed peripheral opacity at right lung base, partially obscuring the lateral aspect of the right hemidiaphragm. This is likely due to a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis, and a similar appearance to this region is noted on an earlier radiograph of ___, 5:00 a.m. Within the left hemithorax, persistent small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent left basilar atelectasis are noted.
