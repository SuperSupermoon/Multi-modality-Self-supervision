A left internal central jugular venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava. There is no pneumothorax. The patient remains intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its termination point not imaged, however. Lung volumes are low and there is persistent retrocardiac opacification that is not specific, although typical for atelectasis. Etiologies such as pneumonia or aspiration are also possible in addition to probable coinciding pleural effusion. The pulmonary vascularity appears prominent along each hilum and indistinct suggesting vascular congestion that has somewhat worsened.
