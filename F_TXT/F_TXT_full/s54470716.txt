Right apical pneumothorax is less conspicuous than before, likely resolved. Cardiomegaly is stable. Moderate vascular congestion has improved. Moderate-to-large right effusion with adjacent atelectasis has probably increased allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is unchanged. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the main pulmonary artery. Left PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
