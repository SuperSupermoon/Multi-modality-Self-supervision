Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates very low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There are persistent bilateral parenchymal peribronchial opacities, which is improving from the prior study. The heart size is normal. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, consistent with known mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. Right subclavian central venous line ends at the mid-SVC.
