Again seen is a right hydropneumothorax, and associated right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema, that is not significantly changed when compared to the most recent study. Right lung and lower left lobe opacities are grossly unchanged though appear slightly more consolidated on today's study which is likely secondary to positional changes. Small to moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged Right chest tube remains unchanged in position terminating at the apex of the lung. A Dobhoff tube remains unchanged in position.
