AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours and pleural surfaces are unremarkable. Lungs are clear. A healed fracture is noted in the right lower ribs posteriorly. If there are focal findings suggesting chest wall trauma, detailed views of those regions should be obtained.
