Right-sided Port-A-Cath and left apical pleural catheter are unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. No pneumothorax. Mild perihilar interstitial edema appears somewhat improved. More focal opacity at the left base likely reflects a combination of layering effusion and compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
