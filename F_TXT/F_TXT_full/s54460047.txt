1. Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. 2. Interval improvement in aeration in the right mid lung with only a fine linear residual opacity likely reflecting scarring or residual subsegmental atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacity possibly represents a partial lower lobe atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Left costophrenic angle is not well visualized but this could be related to positioning rather than representing a layering pleural effusion. Followup imaging would be advised, however. A 5-mm radiopaque opacity at the right apex may be related to a rib or possibly represent a calcified granuloma given its density. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable.
