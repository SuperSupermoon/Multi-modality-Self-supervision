A trauma board slightly limits evaluation of this radiograph. The endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating 1.8 cm above the level of the carina. A new enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly. There has been interval placement of a right subclavian central venous catheter, ending near the superior cavoatrial junction. The exam is otherwise unchanged compared to the prior radiographs from 25 minutes ago. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
