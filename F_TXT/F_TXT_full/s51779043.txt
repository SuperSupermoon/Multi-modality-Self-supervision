Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases. Patchy ill-defined opacities within the lung bases, more so on the left, may reflect areas of aspiration, infection, or possibly atelectasis. The heart size is normal. The aorta appears tortuous. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
