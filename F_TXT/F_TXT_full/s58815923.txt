Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump is less than a cm from the apex of the aortic knob, higher than generally placed. Heart size is normal, but pulmonary edema is mild. Hilar enlargement, presumably vascular, should be re-evaluated after hemodynamic status improves to exclude adenopathy. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
