A tracheostomy is in-situ. A tunneled internal jugular dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium. A right-sided PICC is also in-situ, the tip is difficult to visualize but appears to be in the proximal SVC. There are persistent bilateral predominately perihilar airspace opacities with hazy pulmonary vascular consistent with pulmonary edema. Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis. No pneumothorax seen.
