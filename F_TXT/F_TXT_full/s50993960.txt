There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter with tip projecting over the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Otherwise, there is been no change. Probable moderate right pleural effusion is again seen with vague right upper lung opacity less clearly delineated. Cardiomegaly with mitral annular calcifications. Retrocardiac opacity suspicious for hiatal hernia. Lumbar levoscoliosis is noted.
