A PICC line terminates at the right lower superior vena cava. The heart is probably enlarged to a mild degree. There is marked unfolding of the aorta and the arch may be dilated. Flattening of the right costophrenic sulcus suggests potentially an effusion versus pleural thickening or scarring, but the lungs appear clear. Left-sided rib deformities appear very likely chronic, with a remodeled appearance, and probably related to remote prior trauma.
