The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 4.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Streaky opacity at the right base suggests minor atelectasis, but otherwise there is better aeration, particularly at the left lung base.
