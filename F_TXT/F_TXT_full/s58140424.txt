In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and probably mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, though less prominent than on the previous study. The multifocal areas of opacification bilaterally are also less prominent. Opacification at the left base most likely reflects atelectasis and pleural fluid. The right pleural catheter remains in place and there is no definite pneumothorax.
