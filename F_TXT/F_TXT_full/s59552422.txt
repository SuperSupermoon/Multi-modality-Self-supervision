The tip of a right PICC line projects over the right axilla, but has a slight turn, and may be entering one of the tributaries of the right axillary vein. Lumbar spine fixation rods are partially imaged. There is a small left pleural effusion. Increased retrocardiac opacification may be due to a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid, however pneumonia is a possibility in the appropriate clinical setting. The right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal despite the projection.
