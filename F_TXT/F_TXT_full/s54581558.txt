AP chest compared to ___ at 12:12 a.m.: Moderate left pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions and a small collection of subcutaneous gas in the left chest wall and supraclavicular region, all stable. Also unchanged is the relatively global but somewhat heterogeneous opacification in both lungs. There is no way to exclude pneumonia as the cause of some or all of this abnormality, but the pattern of changes is also consistent with asymmetric edema, not necessarily cardiogenic. It might be useful to evaluate the lungs with CT scanning if the problem persists after treatment for edema. Right PIC line ends at a level more than 8 cm below the carina, would need to be withdrawn 4 cm to reposition it with confidence in the low SVC, if that is desired. ET tube is in standard position. Feeding tube ends in the stomach.
