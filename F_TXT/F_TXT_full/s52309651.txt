Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Retrocardiac opacity is increased over the interval and may represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. The endotracheal tube ends 4.4 cm from the carina. The intra-aortic balloon pump tip ends 1.8 cm from the aortic arch and is in acceptable position. The nasogastric tube tip ends in the distal esophagus, with the last side port at the level of the carina. No pneumothorax. The pacer lead is no longer present on this view.
