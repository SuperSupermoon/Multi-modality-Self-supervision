Since the prior chest radiograph performed 1 day earlier, there has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which terminates 3.9 cm above the carina. A transesophageal catheter extends to at least the body of the stomach, although the tip is not visualized. There is at least moderate gaseous distension of the stomach. Pulmonary edema is mild, although worse from the prior study performed earlier on the same date. Dense left retrocardiac opacity most likely represents atelectasis. No sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cervical spine fusion hardware is incidentally noted.
