Assessment is limited due to positioning. The endotracheal tube ends 3.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is in place with the tip out of view. Lung volumes are low. There is bilateral hilar engorgement and pulmonary edema. Apparent mediastinal widening may be due to positioning. Patchy opacities in the retrocardiac region in both the right and the left aspects of the heart may represent atelectasis although infiltrative process cannot be excluded. There may be a small layering left-sided pleural effusion. No right-sided pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax.
