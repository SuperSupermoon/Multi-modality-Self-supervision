Clearing of the left lung apex is probably due to improving pulmonary edema. Large left pleural effusion is slightly smaller. Both lower lobes are consolidated, but whether this is pneumonia or dependent edema and atelectasis is radiographically indeterminate. Severe cardiomegaly, distended mediastinal veins, and huge pulmonary arteries are chronic.
