Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for marked leftward patient rotation. A nonspecific opacity has developed within the left retrocardiac area, partially obscuring the descending thoracic aortic interface and medial left hemidiaphragm contour. This is most likely due to a focal area of atelectasis, but differential diagnosis includes aspiration and developing infectious pneumonia. Otherwise, no relevant short interval change in the appearance of the chest.
