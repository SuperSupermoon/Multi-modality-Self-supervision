AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding AP single view chest examination of ___. Status post sternotomy and right-sided PICC line as before. During the latest one-day examination interval, thoracocentesis has been performed on the left side with marked reduction of the pleural density. On the frontal AP view, one can now identify the diaphragmatic contours again and only mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus remains. The left-sided pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area. In comparison with the next previous examination, a mild thickening of the apical pleura existed already at that time.
