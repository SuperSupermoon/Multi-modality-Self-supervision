Comparison is made to previous study from ___, at 5:45 a.m. There has been placement of an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3.7 cm above the carina. There is unchanged left-sided chest tube. A tiny left apical pneumothorax is seen. A feeding tube device is seen with the distal tip just below the GE junction. This could be advanced a few centimeters for more optimal placement. There is improved aeration at the right base where there are areas of consolidation. Elevated left hemidiaphragm obscures portions of the left retrocardiac area.
