Lung volumes are extremely low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature. Within this context, heart size is likely normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Bibasilar opacities are present, likely representing atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
