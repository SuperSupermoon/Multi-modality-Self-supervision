Endotracheal tube is seen with tip 3.3 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the diaphragm with side port likely within the stomach. Right-sided subclavian central venous catheter tip projects over the upper SVC. Bibasilar opacities are seen, left greater than right which could represent a combination of atelectasis, consolidation or effusion. Somewhat linear left upper lung opacity is also noted for which followup will be recommended on future exams. There is prominence of the left hilum, potentially in part projectional.
