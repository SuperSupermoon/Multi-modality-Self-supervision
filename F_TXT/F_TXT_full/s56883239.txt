CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present, tip at the level of the upper clavicles, approximately 6.4 cm above the carina. NG tube present, tip in the left upper quadrant, presumably overlying gastric fundus. Left subclavian central line tip lies at the SVC/RA junction. Right-sided chest tube present. No pneumothorax identified at this time. There is a small-to-moderate left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Patchy increased markings at the right base are noted, most likely atelectasis. No gross right-sided effusion identified. Allowing for low lung volumes, doubt CHF. Compared with ___ at 15:55 p.m., I doubt significant interval change. No gross right-sided pneumothorax identified.
