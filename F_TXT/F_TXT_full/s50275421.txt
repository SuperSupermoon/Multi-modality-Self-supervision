New pigtail pleural catheter has been placed in the lower left hemithorax with associated decrease in left pleural effusion and no visible pneumothorax. Residual small-to-moderate left effusion is present and may be loculated laterally. Improved aeration at the left lung with residual multifocal patchy opacities remaining. Right lung is grossly clear, and there is no evidence of a right pleural effusion.
