Interval placement of a left basilar pigtail catheter with decrease in size of the loculated basilar hydropneumothorax. The left apical pneumothorax also appears to be slightly smaller. There is persistent partial left lower lobe atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. Improved aeration at the right base with minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely representing a tiny effusion. Residual right lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
