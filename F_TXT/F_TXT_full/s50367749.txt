Right subclavian catheter has been withdrawn slightly, now terminating at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for rotation. Improving left lower lobe opacity but new patchy opacity has developed at the right base. The latter may reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion is present, but there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
