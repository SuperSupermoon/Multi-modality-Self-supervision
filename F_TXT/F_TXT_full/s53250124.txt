As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new left subclavian line. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the upper-to-mid SVC. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. The other monitoring and support devices, including the nasogastric tube, a post-surgical tube at the bases of the left hemithorax, an endotracheal tube, and the right Port-A-Cath are constant in appearance. As compared to the prior image, the right lung is better ventilated. The pre-described opacities at the left lung base persist.
