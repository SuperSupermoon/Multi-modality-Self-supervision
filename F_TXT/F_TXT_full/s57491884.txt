Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy appear similar to the prior radiograph when allowances are made for lower lung volumes on the current study. Heart size is normal. Right lower lobe infrahilar opacity is probably unchanged, as well as a cluster of small branching opacities in the right mid lung region, the latter corresponding to small airways disease on recent CT. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum following the recent procedure.
