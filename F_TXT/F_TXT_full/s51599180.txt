In comparison with study of ___, there is again evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with atelectatic streak at the left base. However, the pulmonary vessels are less distinct, consistent with the clinical impression of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Of incidental note is an old healed fracture of the right clavicle.
