A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are increased on the left and decreased on the right. The upper lung zones are clear and pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. The right apical pneumothorax is not seen on this semiupright study. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The left chest wall pacemaker leads are unchanged in position.
