Wires and tubes overlying the left upper chest and bilateral lower lung fields are outside the patient. There is an opacity at the right base, which is likely aspiration. An early pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary edema. A thin linear lucency along the right heart border corresponds to the known small right pneumothorax. Within the limitations of a different modality, there is no significant change in its size. There is no left pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
