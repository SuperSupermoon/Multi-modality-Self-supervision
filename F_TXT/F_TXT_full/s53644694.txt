A single supine portable frontal view of the chest was performed. A right upper extremity PICC has been removed in the interim. The previously seen multi focal parenchymal opacities within the right lung are improved on this study. The left lung is essentially clear. There has been resolution of the right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. A tortuous aorta is redemonstrated. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
