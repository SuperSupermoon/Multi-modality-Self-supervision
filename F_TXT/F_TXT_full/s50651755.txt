Since the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, the endotracheal tube has been slightly retracted, now terminating well above the level of the clavicles, approximately 9.8 cm above the carina. This could be advanced several cm for standard positioning. Side-port of nasogastric tube is proximal to the GE junction and could be advanced several cm. Exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening opacity in the right middle and right lower lobes with associated volume loss. This may reflect worsening atelectasis with or without coexisting aspiration or infectious consolidation.
