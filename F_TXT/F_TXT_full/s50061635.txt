Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There are extremely low lung volumes and the patient's chin overlaps the left upper lung field. This limits the study. There is crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings at the bases with subsegmental atelectasis. There is also a basilar left-sided pleural effusion. Overall, these findings are stable. No large pneumothoraces or definite consolidation are identified.
