Comparison is also made with a prior CT chest from ___. The patient is known to have severe emphysema which is exemplified on chest radiograph with hyperinflated and hyperlucent lungs. Suture material is noted along the left mid lung, compatible with prior resection. There is no focal consolidation, large effusion, or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable and stable with atherosclerotic calcification again noted along the aortic knob. Bony structures appear stable with a bony deformity of the left humeral neck, unchanged as compared with a prior radiograph from ___. An osteotomy involving the left fifth posterior rib arch is stable.
