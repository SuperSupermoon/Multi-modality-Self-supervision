Single portable AP radiograph through the chest demonstrates hyperinflated lungs. Prominent right cardiophrenic fat pad is again noted obscuring the right heart border. Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle is noted most compatible with atelectasis. No large pleural effusion is seen. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable in appearance. Heart size is normal. There is cephalization of central vessels without overt pulmonary ___. Aortic arch calcifications are incidentally noted. Osseous structures demonstrate no acute abnormality. Dextroscoliosis is again seen.
