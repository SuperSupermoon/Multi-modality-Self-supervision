Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. The heart remains stably enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Interval decrease in size of a right pleural effusion. Persistent retrocardiac consolidation may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Interval appearance of mild perihilar edema. No obvious pneumothorax.
