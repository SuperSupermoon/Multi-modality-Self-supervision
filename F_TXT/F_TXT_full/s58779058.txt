Severe elevation of the left lung base worsened between ___ earlier today. It could be due entirely to markedly elevated left hemidiaphragm, paralyzed, injured, or even trachea. There could also be a component of diaphragmatic herniation. Beneath the long or diaphragm the colon is moderately distended, but the stomach is normal caliber. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. Atelectasis at the base of the severely displaced left lung is moderate to severe. Right lung is clear. Mediastinum is midline. Left heart border is obscured so heart size cannot be determined.
