A right pleural catheter ends along the mid lateral right chest wall, not significantly changed. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly, as before. There are midline sternotomy wires and right hemi-thoracic surgical clips. Skin ___ overlie the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax. Widespread heterogeneous opacities throughout the left lung are substantially increased compared to the prior radiograph from ___, new compared to the radiographs from ___, either asymmetric pulmonary edema or widespread infection. Right mid-to-lower lung subsegmental atelectasis is increased. A substantial persistent right pleural space is decreased compared to the most recent study from ___. An unchanged wedge-shaped right upper lobe opacity could be secondary to right middle lobe collapse. The heart size is normal. There is no left pleural effusion. Subcutaneous air along the right lateral chest wall is decreased. Multiple right-sided rib defects/deformities and resection of the medial aspect of the right clavicle are redemonstrated.
