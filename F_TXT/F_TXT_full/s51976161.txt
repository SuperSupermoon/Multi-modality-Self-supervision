There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium without evidence of pneumothorax. In the interval since the prior study, there has been significant interval increase in perihilar opacities worrisome for moderate pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen although a trace right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude.
