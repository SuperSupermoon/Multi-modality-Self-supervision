Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is detected. Multiple clips are again noted within the right neck.
