AP chest compared to ___ at 2:05 a.m.: Pulmonary edema developed between ___ and ___ worsening through ___, with concurrent right upper lung consolidation. Nothing has changed since 2:05 a.m. today, but there is more edema than there was on ___. Small to moderate volume of bilateral pleural effusion is presumed but difficult to assess because of lack of clarity about actual patient position during this study. The heart is normal size. ET tube, left subclavian line, nasogastric tube in standard placements. There is no pneumothorax. Given the overall severity of pulmonary edema it is hard to say whether presumed right-sided pneumonia is worsening or essentially unchanged since its appearance when it preceded the edema.
