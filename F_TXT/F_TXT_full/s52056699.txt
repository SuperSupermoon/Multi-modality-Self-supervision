As compared to the previous radiograph, there are improved lung volumes, likely the cause of improved ventilation. The areas of atelectasis at the lung bases have decreased. Also decreased is the pre-existing opacity around the left hilus. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No overt pulmonary edema. Unchanged course and position of the left double-lumen catheter.
