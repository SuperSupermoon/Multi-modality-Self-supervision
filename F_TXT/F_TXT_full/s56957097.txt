AP chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with chest CT on ___: Postoperative lung volumes are quite low, and bibasilar opacification is more likely atelectasis than aspiration, but should be followed. Small pleural effusions are presumed. There is no pneumothorax. Right apical pleural tube in standard position. The exact position of a second longer drain that traverses the midline is uncertain. Clinical correlation advised. Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes, and there is minimal if any mediastinal widening.
