Lung volumes are slightly low. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. Mild pulmonary vascular prominence may be exaggerated by low lung volumes. Heart and mediastinal contours are also exaggerated by low lung volumes. An enteric catheter terminates in the epigastric region likely within the distal stomach. An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. There is right acromioclavicular separation, incompletely imaged. A small ossified fragment superior to the left distal clavicle is likely chronic.
