A right-sided single lead pacer remains in place with the lead appearing intact and terminating over the expected location of the right ventricle. The heart is enlarged favoring cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. Interval increase in lung volumes with prominent perihilar vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity at the right medial lung base may represent atelectasis, although early pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. No pneumothorax.
