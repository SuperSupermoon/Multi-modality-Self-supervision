Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. The cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits. Visualization of the lung bases is suboptimal due to overlapping soft tissue structures, however there appears to be increased opacity with partial silhouetting of the left heart border suspicious for lingular consolidation. A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.
