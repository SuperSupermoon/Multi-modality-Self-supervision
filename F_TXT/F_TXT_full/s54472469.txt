Single supine view of the chest. Endotracheal tube seen with tip 6.5 cm from the carina, just above the clavicular heads and can be advanced 2 cm for optimal positioning. Nasogastric tube seen with tip in the gastric body. Low lung volumes are seen. Mild left basilar opacity silhouettes the left costophrenic angle, potentially due to atelectasis. Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear. Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged and there is prominence of the aortic knob. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
