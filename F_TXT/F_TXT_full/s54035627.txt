In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes with right chest tube in place. Apical pleural capping is seen, but no definite pneumothorax. The tip of the endotracheal tube remains in the supraclavicular region, though only 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. Pulmonary vasculature is essentially within normal limits. There is an area of increased opacification in the right upper zone that could reflect pulmonary contusion. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
