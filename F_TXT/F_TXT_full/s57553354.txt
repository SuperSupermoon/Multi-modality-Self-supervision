As compared to the previous image, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. As expected, the lung volumes have decreased, with minimal bilateral small pleural effusions. Mild-to-moderate areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. Mild fluid overload persists, but the extent and severity is less than on the previous images. The left internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position.
