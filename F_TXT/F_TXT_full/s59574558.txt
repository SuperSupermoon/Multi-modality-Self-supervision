In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much better inspiration. Continued opacification at the right base with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural fluid and underlying compressive atelectasis. There is the development of increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal and there is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view. There has been insertion of a right IJ catheter that extends to the mid portion of the SVC. No evidence of post procedure pneumothorax.
