The patient has been intubated with the endotracheal tube tip projecting approximately 5.6 cm above the carina. There is a moderate right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Since prior, haziness of the right lung has mildly increased, likely due to a layering effusion. Underlying edema is difficult to exclude. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stably enlarged. Median sternotomy wires and pacing leads are unchanged.
