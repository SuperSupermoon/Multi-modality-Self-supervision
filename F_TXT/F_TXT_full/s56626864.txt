Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Upper zone vascular redistribution is present without overt pulmonary edema. Rapid interval improvement in left mid and lower lung opacities, which may have been due to aspiration and/or atelectasis. Residual linear atelectasis remains. On the right, there is a persistent partially layering moderate-sized pleural effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis.
