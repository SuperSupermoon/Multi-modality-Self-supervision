A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. Lung volumes are slightly low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. There is consolidative left mid-to-lower lung opacification with streaky opacities in right lower lung, concerning for infection versus aspiration. A concomitant small left pleural effusion is likely. There is no right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Although difficult to accurately assess, the heart size is likely mildly enlarged, not significantly changed. No definite rib fractures are identified. There is incompletely assessed spinal fusion hardware.
