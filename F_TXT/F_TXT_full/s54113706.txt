Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. Slight interval improvement in the left lower lobe atelectasis. A nasogastric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm in the expected location of the stomach. Unchanged mild vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. An airspace opacity in the left mid lung may reflect atelectasis versus consolidation. Continued attention on followup recommended.
