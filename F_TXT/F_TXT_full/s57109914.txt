In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued extensive opacification at the left base with elevation of the hemidiaphragm consistent with volume loss and effusion. Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, though there is only mild elevation of pulmonary vascular pressure. Continued marked narrowing of the trachea, which again could contribute to respiratory insufficiency when the patient is breathing without positive pressure support. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. No definite acute pneumonia, pneumothorax, or mediastinal air.
