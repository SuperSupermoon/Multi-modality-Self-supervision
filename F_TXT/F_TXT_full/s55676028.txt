Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Pulmonary masses and nodules appear similar, consistent with known history of metastatic disease. Worsening opacities at both lung bases could potentially be due to aspiration pneumonia given clinical suspicion for this entity. Left lateral pleural opacity is unchanged, and probably corresponds to a combination of pleural fluid and known extrapleural fat in this region.
