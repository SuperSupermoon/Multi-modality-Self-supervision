As compared to the previous image, the endotracheal tube has been advanced. The tube is now within 1.5 cm of the carina and should be pulled back by approximately 1 cm. The course and position of the nasogastric tube is unchanged. The volumes have minimally decreased. This causes an apparent increase in extent and severity of the preexisting basal and lateral opacities. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant in appearance. No larger pleural effusions are seen.
