Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the level of the carina. Left-sided central venous catheter is stable in position. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. Basilar-predominant opacities are again seen, somewhat increased in the right lung base since the prior study, although more similar to ___ at 15:56. The most recent comparison is from 18:19. No large pleural effusions are seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are stable with calcification in the aortic knob.
