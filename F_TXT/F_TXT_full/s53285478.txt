In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the opaque tip of the Dobhoff tube appears to have been pulled back slightly so that it is minimally distal to the esophagogastric junction were may be even straddling it. The tube should be pushed forward at least 8-10 cm for better positioning. Continued increased opacification at the bases silhouetting the hemidiaphragms is consistent with pleural effusion and atelectatic changes. More focal area of opacification is seen in the right mid to lower lung zone. This is worrisome for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is concerning for developing elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
