Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the proximal SVC near the confluence of veins. The right pleural pigtail catheter is unchanged in position positioned within a loculated pleural effusion. Small left effusion likely not significantly changed given differences in inspiration. Patchy bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration and pneumonia should also be considered. No obvious pneumothorax. Increasing prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and perihilar vessels suggests worsening interstitial edema. Clinical correlation is advised. Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.
