The right lung volume is low compared to the left side. There are new and linear opacities in the right lower lobe, likely atelectasis versus consolidation. Aspiration pneumonitis is also a consideration. There is diffuse prominence of interstitial markings as well as vascular prominence. The right main bronchus is not clearly visualized and there is deviation of the distal trachea to the left side. This may reflect presence of a hematoma in this region related to the recent surgery. There is mild cardiomegaly and widening of the superior mediastinum. Epidural catheter is seen in place. Metallic hardware projects over the lower cervical spine.
