Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Widespread pulmonary metastases are new from ___, and have apparently increased in size since recent CTA of ___. A small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is new, and a small left pleural effusion has increased in size from the CTA. Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis but short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude the possibility of basilar pneumonia on the right. Known lytic lesion involving the right fourth anterior rib has been more fully characterized on recent CTA.
