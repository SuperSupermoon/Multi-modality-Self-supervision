Nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line unchanged in position. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient positioning. Bilateral parenchymal opacities with a more consolidative appearance at the left base are likely not significantly changed given differences in technique between studies and are consistent with reported NSIP. Pneumonia or aspiration at the left base cannot be excluded. There is residual right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. No obvious pneumothorax.
