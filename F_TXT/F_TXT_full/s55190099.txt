1. Interval removal of the left pleural catheter with no evidence of a pneumothorax. There is increasing linear opacity at the left base most likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis. In addition, there are likely small effusions, right greater than left. Patchy opacity at the right base likely reflects compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Embolization coil is seen projecting over the left upper quadrant in this patient status post embolization of a splenic pseudoaneurysm. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient rotation between the studies.
