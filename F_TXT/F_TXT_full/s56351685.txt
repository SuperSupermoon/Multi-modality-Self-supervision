In comparison with the earlier study of this day, there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with poorly defined markings suggesting some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Scatter radiation related to the size of the patient makes it difficult to fully evaluate the image. The left hemidiaphragm is less well seen, which could be a manifestation of volume loss and small effusion. No definite acute focal pneumonia, though the retrocardiac region cannot be properly evaluated in the absence of a lateral view.
