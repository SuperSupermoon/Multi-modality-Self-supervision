Comparison is made with prior study performed 11 hours earlier. Aeration of the right lung has minimally improved. Ill-defined opacities in the left perihilar and left lower lobes have improved. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip cannot be assessed due to technique, can be followed to the level of the lower esophagus. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
