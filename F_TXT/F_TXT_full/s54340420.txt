The right lower pleural tube has been re-positioned slightly. Moderate right apical pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall are stable. Right pleural thickening suggests recent pleurodesis. Left lung clear. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Previous saccular bronchiectasis in the right upper lung may have improved, suggesting an acute component, unless of course the patient has had interval surgery.
