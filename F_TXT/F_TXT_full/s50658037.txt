Comparison is made to the prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube is 6.6 cm above the carina. There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities, greater on the left side, have increased, consistent with increasing atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion has minimally increased. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. Widened mediastinum is stable. There is no pneumothorax. NG tube tip is at the fundus of the stomach, in unchanged position.
