The study is somewhat limited due to the apical lordotic view. There is a vague opacity in the right lung base which obscures the right hemidiaphragmatic contour. The lungs are otherwise clear. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vascular markings appear normal. Incidental note is made of an old left clavicular fracture.
