The heart size is top normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours remain within normal limits. There is central vascular engorgement, without overt edema. Since ___ there is slight left volume loss with increased left retrocardiac opacity, likely reflecting atelectasis, though small consolidation at the left base cannot be excluded. Moderate calcifications are again seen throughout the aortic arch. There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation. A trace left pleural effusion is unchanged.
