Single supine frontal view of the chest was obtained. Bilateral pleural effusions are difficult to directly compare to the prior exam due to difference in patient position. Allowing for this limitation, right pleural effusion appears similar to prior, still large, and left pleural effusion appears decreased status post thoracentesis, now small. No pneumothorax. Heart size appears stable. Mediastinal contours are stable. Catheter of a right chest wall port terminates in the right atrium.
