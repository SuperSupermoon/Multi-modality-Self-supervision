Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. A left internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. There are persistent extensive bilateral airspace opacities with cystic areas. The appearances are most consistent with a background interstitial lung disease with superimposed pulmonary edema. The extent of airspace opacity is similar to slightly worse when compared to the prior study. No definite pleural effusion seen. The cardiomediastinal contour cannot be evaluated.
