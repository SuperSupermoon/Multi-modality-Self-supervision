There is mild cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature which is suggestive of increased pulmonary venous pressures. The lungs are clear. Rightward deviation of the trachea in the superior mediastinum is unchanged and due to the patient's known history of thyromegaly. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is not enlarged. A hemodialysis catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Again noted are multiple old left rib fractures as well as degenerative changes of the bilateral glenohumeral joints.
