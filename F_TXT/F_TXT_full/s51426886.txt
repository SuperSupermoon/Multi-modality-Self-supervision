As compared to the previous radiograph, the elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged. A minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded, there is increasing blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, suggesting a mild-to-moderate pleural effusion on the right. The vascular diameters have minimally increased, suggesting mild fluid overload. Unchanged sternotomy wires and ECG cables.
