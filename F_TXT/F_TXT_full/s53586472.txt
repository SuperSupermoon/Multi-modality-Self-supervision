A left-sided pacemaker is unchanged in configuration. There is been interval extubation and removal an orogastric tube, mediastinal drains, left thoracostomy tube, and Swan-Ganz catheter. There is no pneumothorax. There is increased atelectasis at the right and left lung bases secondary to lower lung volumes. Extensive pleural base calcifications across the left hemithorax are again seen.
