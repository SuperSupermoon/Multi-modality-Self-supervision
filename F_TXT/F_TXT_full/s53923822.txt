In comparison with the study of ___, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. Slightly improved lung volumes with continued cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration. Opacification at the right base persists, most likely reflecting a combination of pleural fluid and atelectatic changes. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No definite acute focal pneumonia. However, there is mild asymmetry in the mid to lower zones with opacification on the right. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent a developing consolidation.
