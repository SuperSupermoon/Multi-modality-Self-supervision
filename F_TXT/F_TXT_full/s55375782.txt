Compared to 1 day earlier, no gross change is detected in the right 1. Again seen is 1 and ? 2 right-sided chest tubes, with probable small right apical pneumothorax. Chain sutures at the right lung apex and 2 surgical clips to the right of the carina are again noted. Minimal subcutaneous emphysema in the right supraclavicular region is again seen. Also again seen is patchy opacity at the right base, with blunting of the right costophrenic angle and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, similar to the prior film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and appears midline. The left lung is grossly clear, without CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion. Previously seen left base atelectasis and blunting of left costophrenic angle has resolved.
