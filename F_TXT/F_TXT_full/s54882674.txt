Bibasilar opacities are again seen silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, suggestive of pleural effusions. Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen superiorly. There is more focal opacity in the right infrahilar region. There is likely cardiomegaly although given silhouetting, assessment is limited. No acute osseous abnormalities.
