As compared to the previous radiograph, the tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. The pre-existing severe pulmonary edema has improved, but the edema is still moderate in severity. The bilateral pleural effusions have resolved, so that the costophrenic sinuses are again seen. The heart continues to be moderately enlarged, with bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. No new parenchymal opacities.
