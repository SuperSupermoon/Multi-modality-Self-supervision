AP chest compared to ___: New mild interstitial edema and interval increase in caliber of mediastinal veins suggests mild cardiac decompensation. New CoreValve noted in standard position. New transvenous right ventricular temporary pacer lead follows the expected course. No pneumothorax or evidence of mediastinal bleeding. Small left pleural effusion is new. Apparent nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lung laterally should be re-evaluated with conventional radiographs when feasible.
