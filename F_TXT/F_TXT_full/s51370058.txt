A portable upright AP chest radiograph shows a large right pleural effusion obscuring the right lung base with what appears to be loculation medially. This, as well as hazy opacity in the left mid lung are not significantly different compared to yesterday's study, but appear increased compared to ___. The side hole of the patient's nasogastric tube is just above the level of the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced. Some radiodense contrast persists in the colon, probably from abdominal CT scan.
