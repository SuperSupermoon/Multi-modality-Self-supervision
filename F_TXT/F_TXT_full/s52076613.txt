Left PICC is now malpositioned, with distal tip directed cephalad coursing just above the medial aspect of the right clavicle likely in the right internal jugular vein. Widespread pulmonary nodules are again demonstrated consistent with metastases. A new confluent opacity has developed in the left retrocardiac region, and may reflect atelectasis, aspiration and less likely rapidly evolving pneumonia. The gastric bubble appears compressed in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, likely due to known pancreatic tail mass in this region. Position of PICC has been communicated by phone to Dr. ___ by telephone on ___ at 8:45 a.m. at the time of discovery.
