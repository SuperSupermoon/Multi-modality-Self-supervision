Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and left basilar atelectasis. LUNG BASES ARE PARTIALLY OBSCURED AND WOULD BE BETTER EVALUATED WITH A LATERAL VIEW, WHEN FEASIBLE. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contour is normal.
