Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Streaky, bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, which likely represent atelectasis. The left costophrenic angle is somewhat blunted, which may reflect a small pleural effusion versus chronic scarring. The descending thoracic aorta is unfolded. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise grossly within normal limits and without evidence of pneumomediastinum. No pneumoperitoneum.
