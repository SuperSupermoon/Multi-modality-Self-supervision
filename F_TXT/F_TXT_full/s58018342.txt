As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is a persistent moderate right pneumothorax. The apical component has slightly improved. The basilar portion of the pneumothorax is now occupied by a new fluid component; it does not however demonstrate the classic air fluid level required for a hydropneumothorax. Right chest tubes are in unchanged position. There is an increased opacity at the right lung base which may be related to reexpansion edema, atelectasis or an early infectious process. Small amount of subcutaneous air is seen in the lateral chest wall on the right. The left lung remains clear and the cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
