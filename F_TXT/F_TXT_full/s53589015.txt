AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___: Patient has had median sternotomy, and wires are undisturbed since ___. Borderline cardiomegaly is also stable. There is now pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion. There are no large lung nodules, but small septic emboli are not likely to be obvious given the limitations of radiographic technique in a setting of mild pulmonary edema. ET tube is in standard position and an upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
