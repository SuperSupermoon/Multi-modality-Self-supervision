AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, the patient has been extubated. Other lines and tubes remain in unchanged position. An NG tube can again be identified. It reaches now down to the fundus of the stomach including the side port which has just past the hiatus area. On the preceding film, an NG tube was present reaching far down into the small bowel area.
