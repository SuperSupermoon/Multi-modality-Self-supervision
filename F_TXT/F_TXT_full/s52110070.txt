Right chest tube remains in place, with a small right apicolateral pneumothorax, which in retrospect is unchanged since the prior study. Right pleural effusion and pleural masses are similar, but there has been slight improvement in adjacent atelectasis at the right lung base. Within the left lung, there has been improved aeration in the left retrocardiac region. Localized linear atelectasis is demonstrated in the left lower lobe peripherally.
