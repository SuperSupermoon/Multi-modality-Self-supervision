There is mild hyperinflation. The trachea is central. The cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits. The heart is not enlarged. No pleural effusion, consolidation or pneumothorax seen. There is a 9 mm opacity projecting over the left sixth rib anteriorly. This is not clearly seen on the prior study and may reflect a lesion within the rib raw low no true pulmonary parenchymal abnormality. Suggest oblique views of the ribs initially to better localize.
