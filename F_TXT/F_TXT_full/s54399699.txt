Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No radiopaque foreign body is demonstrated.
