As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. Lung volumes have increased. There is a remnant opacity at the right lung base, potentially reflecting either atelectasis or pneumonia. Minimal plate-like atelectasis at the level of the left hilus. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions.
