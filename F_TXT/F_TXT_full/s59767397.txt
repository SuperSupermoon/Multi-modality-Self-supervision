Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 6.5 cm above the carina, just above the level of the clavicles. Right subclavian catheter courses into the high right atrium, as seen previously. Esophageal catheter courses below the diaphragm with side port likely just distal to the gastroesophageal junction, unchanged. There has been interval removal of bilateral chest tubes, with one left chest tube remaining. No pneumothorax is detected on these views. Small left pleural effusion persists. Sternal wires and left upper quadrant surgical clips are noted.
