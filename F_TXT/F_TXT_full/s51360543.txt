Chest tubes remain in place in the left hemithorax with no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with persistent widening of the mediastinum at the level of the aortic arch in this patient status post previous surgery for aortic transsection. Atelectasis in left retrocardiac region is again demonstrated, as well as a small left pleural effusion. Within the right lung, an area of focal atelectasis in the right upper lobe has resolved, and minimal peribronchiolar opacities are present in the right infrahilar region, and may reflect atelectasis or focal aspiration. Moderate gastric distention is noted in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, as well as postoperative changes in the spine.
