Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is a small amount of bibasilar atelectasis, which is new from the prior study. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, and there is persistent epicardial fat, consistent with prior CT chest findings. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation. A Dobbhoff tube is seen with the tip ending at the GE junction.
