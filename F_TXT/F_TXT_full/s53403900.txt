Two right-sided pigtail catheters are again visualized. There is a small right apical pneumothorax that is decreased in size compared to the film from the prior afternoon. The left hemidiaphragm continues to be mildly enlarged with chain sutures seen in the left hilum. The fiducial placement and right-sided lung mass are again seen. There is volume loss/infiltrate in the right lower lung, similar to prior. The amount of subcutaneous emphysema has decreased.
