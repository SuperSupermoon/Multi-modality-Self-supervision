1. Feeding tube, right internal jugular central line and right subclavian central lines are unchanged. There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 3.5-4 cm above the carina. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status post median sternotomy for CABG. There are layering effusions, right greater than left. There is improved aeration in the left lung with persistent more consolidative opacity in the perihilar region and in the right mid-to-lower lung. These findings could reflect pulmonary edema with some interval improvement, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No pneumothorax. Left-sided pacer is unchanged.
