Heart size is normal. The aorta is diffusely calcified and mildly tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacities at the right base are likely atelectasis. There is minimal pleural thickening at the right base, similar in appearance to the prior studies. A granuloma at the apex of the left lung is unchanged. Otherwise the left lung is clear. No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
