The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. Lung markings are coarse with irregular architecture, suggestive of underlying lung disease. This appearance could be seen with obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease or a mixture of both. The prominence of the interstitium makes it difficult to exclude more acute etiologies, however, such as mild vascular congestion, airway inflammation or atypical infection. There is no definite pleural effusion. Diaphragms are flattened, however, so subpulmonic effusions are not excluded, although the finding may relate to hyperinflation.
