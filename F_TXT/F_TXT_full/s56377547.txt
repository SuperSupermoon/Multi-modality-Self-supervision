AP chest compared to ___ at 12:54 a.m.: Endotracheal tube has been partially withdrawn, now in standard position. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Upper enteric tube ends in the mid portion of a non-distended stomach. Prior mediastinal widening is less pronounced, and is presumably due to venous engorgement since the patient has recently received 10L of intravenous fluid and there was no attempt at a left internal jugular line placement and therefore no cause for concern about mediastinal bleeding. Lung volumes are quite low, exaggerating mild pulmonary edema as well as mediastinal vascular engorgement and heart size, all of which has increased since the initial study last night at 9:18 p.m. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion is small if any.
