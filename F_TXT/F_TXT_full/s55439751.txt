In comparison with the study of ___, the apparent shift of the mediastinum to the left is not definitely appreciated. There is continued poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable pleural effusion. Engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels is again consistent with pulmonary edema. Area of increased opacification in the left mid zone could reflect merely some asymmetric edema or possible supervening pneumonia.
