1. Heart remains enlarged. There is persistent opacification at the left base which may reflect a combination of atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Right lung is grossly clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Fractures of the left seventh through ninth posterolateral ribs are again identified. Deformity of some of the right ribs likely reflects remote fractures. No pneumothorax. Prominent costochondral calcifications. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
