AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lungs are very low in volume, exaggerating vascular crowding, making it difficult to exclude edema. There is no focal abnormality to suggest pneumonia or large scale aspiration. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. Heart size is normal. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube is folded in the stomach, with the tip heading back to the gastroesophageal junction. No pneumothorax.
