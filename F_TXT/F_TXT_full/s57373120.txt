While the bilateral predominantly basilar diffuse opacities, right greater than left, may be contributed to by some vascular congestion, this is still worrisome for bilateral pneumonia. Bilateral small pleural effusions are probable. The tip of the ETT is seen 5.5 cm above the carina. A feeding tube is seen in the stomach continues out of view. The tip of a right IJ catheter is seen in the mid to lower SVC. The tip of an esophageal temperature probe is noted in the standard position. The heart size is unchanged. No pneumothorax. There is a calcified pleural plaque in the right lung base, compatible with prior asbestos exposure.
