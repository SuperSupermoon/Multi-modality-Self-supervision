The newly placed ETT tip is in standard position. An enteric tube is incompletely imaged but traverses the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant, beyond the field of view. Linear atelectasis is present in the left infrahilar region. Lung volumes have slightly improved. Increased opacity in the right infrahilar region could reflect aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No edema. Heart size is normal.
