AP chest compared to ___ through ___: ET tube in standard placement, nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Lung volumes have improved since ___ and the generalized infiltrative pulmonary abnormality looks less severe today than it did on ___. Some of the improvement may be due to better aeration, but I think a component of pulmonary edema has decreased. Mediastinal veins are still engorged, although overall heart size is only top normal. There is probably a component of pulmonary abnormality that is unrelated to edema raising questions about medication induced lung injury, particularly Amiodarone, or infection related to the lung injury such as acute interstitial pneumonia.
