Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. Right central venous line with its tip in the mid SVC. Interval removal of the nasogastric tube. The right lung is relatively well inflated. There is a layering left effusion with retrocardiac consolidation likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
