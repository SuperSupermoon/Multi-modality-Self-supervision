Interval removal of the left chest tube. A lucency along the medial left apex likely represents a tiny apical pneumothorax, which is stable if not slightly smaller than that seen on the ___ plain radiograph from 5:04pm. Followup imaging would be recommended. There continue be layering effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities which may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia can not be excluded. No pulmonary edema. Status post median sternotomy with overall stably enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours.
