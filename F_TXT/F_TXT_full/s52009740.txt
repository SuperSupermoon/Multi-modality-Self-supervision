In comparison with study of ___, there is again complete opacification of the right hemithorax following right pneumonectomy. Left hemithorax shows much less perihilar opacification that previously suggested elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The left lower lobe nodule, well appreciated on CT, is not definitely appreciated. The opaque fiducial seed is also not definitely seen. No evidence of pneumothorax.
