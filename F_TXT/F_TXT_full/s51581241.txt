In comparison with the study of ___, there is an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. IABP tip lies approximately 1.2 cm below the transverse arch of the aorta. The device could be pulled back about 1 cm to be in more optimal position. There is again increased opacification in the retrocardiac region with poor visualization of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. Spinal fusion device is again seen in the thoracolumbar region.
