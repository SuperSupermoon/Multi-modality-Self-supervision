AP chest compared to 1:34 a.m.: Endotracheal tube is in standard position, but the cuff is inflated to the extent that it distends the caliber of the trachea. This could be inadvertent or necessary if the patient has tracheomalacia. Previous borderline interstitial pulmonary edema has cleared. There is no pneumothorax. Lower lungs are minimally atelectatic. The heart is not enlarged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Gaseous distention of the stomach may be a residual of intubation. If there is concern about pneumoperitoneum, an upright view should be obtained. Right internal jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. Right atrial and two right ventricular pacer leads are in place.
