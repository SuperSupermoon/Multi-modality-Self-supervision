AP chest compared to chest radiographs ___, read in conjunction with a CT scan ___: Conventional chest radiograph shows progression of what was already severe multifocal consolidation on the chest CT ___. There is involvement of most of the right lung, sparing the apex and the extreme lung base, and now more of the perihilar left lung. Differential diagnosis is pneumonia or, given the appropriate clinical circumstances, pulmonary hemorrhage. Small left pleural effusion is new and there is enough vascular engorgement of the mediastinal vessels to indicate an increase in intravascular volume. Transvenous pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions. Heart is at least moderately enlarged. No pneumothorax.
