Left lower lung opacity silhouettes the left hemidiaphragm and is consistent with a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Underlying infection cannot be excluded. There is additionally a small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Multiple bilateral nodular opacities are again seen, consistent with known metastatic disease. Heart size is stable.
