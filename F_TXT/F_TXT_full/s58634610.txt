An endotracheal tube has been placed. It is somewhat high-lying, lying approximately 9 cm above the carina and perhaps even above the thoracic inlet. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is patchy opacification of the left lower lung with shifting distribution suggesting substantial persistent atelectasis, including infrahilar air bronchograms. The widened appearance of the mediastinum is stable. The only change is new patchy right infrahilar opacity, which may be associated with atelectasis, noting its rapid onset.
