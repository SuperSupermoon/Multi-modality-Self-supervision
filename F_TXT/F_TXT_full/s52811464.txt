AP portable supine view of the chest. Evaluation is limited by low lung volumes and large body habitus. The lungs are grossly clear. Hila appear slightly congested. The heart and mediastinal contours appear mildly prominent likely due to supine portable technique. No supine evidence for large effusion or pneumothorax. Bony structures are intact.
