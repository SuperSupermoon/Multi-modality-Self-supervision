Evaluation limited due to multiple overlying wires and overlying device. Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest was provided. There is apparent increased opacity in the right upper lung which could reflect pneumonia. Suture material projecting over the right upper lung again noted. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is chronic. Chain suture material projects over the right upper lung. The heart is not enlarged. Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable though right margin is difficult to accurately assess. No pneumothorax.
