The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Bibasilar streaky opacities are likely atelectasis, although pneumonia could be considered in the correct clinical scenario. The low lung volumes prohibit evaluation of heart size. Further apparent widening of the mediastinum may be artifactual. However, if there is concern for aortic pathology, a CT of the chest would be recommended.
