A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates slightly lower lung volumes with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Allowing for this and differences in technique, heart size is likely unchanged. There is increased opacity overlying the bilateral lower lobes, with evidence of a small left pleural effusion, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. A right pleural effusion is trace, if any. There is no pneumothorax. No definite focal consolidation is seen, though the presence of underlying consolidation at the left base would be difficult to exclude. Old healed right sided rib fractures again noted. Clips projecting over the left axilla are unchanged. The visualized upper abdomen is grossly unremarkable.
