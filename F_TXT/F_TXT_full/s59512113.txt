A portable supine AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates that the endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating only 2.3 cm above the carina. The orogastric tube terminates in the lower esophagus and should be advanced. Low lung volumes, mild cardiomegaly, as well as mild pulmonary edema are also noted. Small bilateral pleural effusions are better appreciated on the CT. There is no pneumothorax.
