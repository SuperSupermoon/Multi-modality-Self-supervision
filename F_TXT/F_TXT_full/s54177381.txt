An endotracheal tube is in unchanged position 5.3 cm from the carina. A thinner catheter terminates in the right mainstem bronchus. After discussion with the team, this is purposeful, and a specialized catheter with a valve placed by the interventional pulmonologists. A right internal jugular catheter is unchanged with the tip in the mid SVC. Again, there is a small right apical pneumothorax, unchanged from the prior exam. There is a pigtail catheter in unchanged position, overlying the mid right hemithorax. There is no left pneumothorax. Opacification at the right base is stable. There is no new opacity. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
