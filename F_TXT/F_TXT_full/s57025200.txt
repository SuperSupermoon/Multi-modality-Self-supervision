AP chest compared to 12:34 p.m.: Endotracheal tube has been advanced to standard placement. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema in the left lung is improving. Very severe consolidation in the right lung has also decreased. Whether this is asymmetric edema, hemorrhage or pneumonia is difficult to say at this stage. There is not a large right pleural effusion but some right pleural fluid is presumed. Patient has had median sternotomy and CABG. Heart is moderately enlarged. Mediastinal veins are not as dilated now as they were earlier. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
