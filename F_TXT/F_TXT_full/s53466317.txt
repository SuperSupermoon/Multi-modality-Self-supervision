Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. Vague opacity in the right mid lung field may represent fluid in the fissure. There has been interval clearing at the right base, but there is persistent atelectasis at the left base. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Endotracheal tube ends 3.1 cm from the carina. Left-sided central line and is approximately at the cavoatrial junction. The chest tubes project over the bilateral hemi thoraces. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach in out of the field of view.
