Increased reticular markings are seen, probably in the right lung base, which may be projectional due to difference in patient rotation. Fiducial marker in left lower lobe masslike opacity is again seen. Enlarged right hilum is unchanged compatible with enlarged right pulmonary artery. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged, similar to prior exams. Right chest wall clips again noted.
