Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates complete opacification of the left hemithorax and leftward cardiomediastinal shift consistent with post-pneumonectomy change. The right lung demonstrates increased consolidation in the lower lobe and possibly also the middle lobe suggestive of infection. This distribution would be atypical for edema. There is no pneumothorax or large right effusion.
