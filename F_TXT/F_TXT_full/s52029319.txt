Compared to ___ at 04:54 and allowing for technical differences, there is increased opacity at the left lung base, with new obscuration of left hemidiaphragm, which could reflect a small effusion and/or increased left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is vascular plethora consistent with CHF and opacification of the right mid and lower zones with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. This latter finding likely reflects combination pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette, including widened superior mediastinum, a appears unchanged, with sternotomy wires noted. Tracheostomy tube again noted. Bilateral IJ lines are again noted. No pneumothorax detected. Oblong density in the right paratracheal region is consistent with calcified paratracheal lymph nodes.
