As compared to the previous radiograph, there is little overall change. The lung volumes remain relatively low. There is no focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia or aspiration. No evidence of pneumothorax. No pleural effusions. The size of the cardiac silhouette is normal. Distention of the stomach, despite nasogastric tube. Advancement of the tube by approximately 5 cm could relieve this situation.
