AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained eight hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. Bilateral subclavian approach central venous lines are present, now indicating that a new right-sided subclavian central venous line has been placed. The termination of this line is very close to that of the pre-existing left-sided line and is located to the mid portion of the SVC. No pneumothorax can be identified. The previously described bilateral pleural effusions persist and result in crowded appearance of the basal pulmonary vasculature. There also is an element of perivascular haze and prominence of the vasculature in the upper zones suggestive of markedly increased pulmonary venous pressure. In comparison with the next preceding, the hazy parenchymal densities in the periphery have regressed. An NG tube is present and appears in unchanged position, reaching far below the diaphragm.
