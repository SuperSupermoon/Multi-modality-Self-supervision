Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube side port is within the stomach and tip projects off the inferior border of the film. The lateral aspects of the chest bilaterally are excluded from the field of view. Overlying trauma board limits evaluation. Heart size appears mildly enlarged, but this may be due to supine technique and low lung volumes. Similarly, the mediastinum appears widened, this again may be due to low lung volumes and supine technique. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. Assessment for pneumothorax and pleural effusion are limited, but no large pneumothorax or effusion is seen.
