Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, no significant changes are appreciated. Lung volumes remain very low with prominent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Bibasilar atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular congestion are unchanged. There has been interval removal of an enteric tube. A right-sided IJ central venous catheter is unchanged in position. Median sternotomy wires are midline and intact.
