In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. There is again prominence of interstitial markings, some of which represents elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, while there may be some component of chronic interstitial lung disease. Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with small pleural effusions an basilar atelectasis bilaterally. There is an area of increased opacification in the left upper zone, also seen previously, that could represent a focus of consolidation. The area of possible increased opacification the upper zone on the right is not definitely seen on the current study, though it could be hidden be hind the first rib.
