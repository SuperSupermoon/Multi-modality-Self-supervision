AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Because the patient is large, radiographic interrogation is difficult. There is greater opacity in the right lower hemithorax than the left. This could be consolidation, but it could also be explained by atelectasis and a posteriorly collected pleural effusion. Heart is moderately enlarged, mediastinum is widened in part due to fat deposition, but an azygos fissure displays the azygos vein which is distended indicating elevated central venous pressure or volume, accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. If there is any left pleural effusion, it is small. Cardiomegaly is moderate, but exaggerated by what may well be non-erect positioning. No pneumothorax.
