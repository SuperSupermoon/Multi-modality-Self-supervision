As compared with previous radiograph from earlier the same date, a left retrocardiac opacity has increased in extent, likely corresponding to a combination of worsening effusion and adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation. Right basilar atelectasis has worsened in the interval and a possible small right pleural effusion has developed. No other relevant changes.
