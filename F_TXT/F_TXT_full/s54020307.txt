In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained approximately 7 hours prior, there has been interval placement of an enteric tube which terminates in the distal stomach. Mid left lung opacity identified on prior radiograph is not well appreciated on the current study, possibly due to differences in patient positioning. There is increased retrocardiac opacification. Increased right lower lung opacities may be exaggerated by superimposed projection projection of the inferior right scapula. These opacities may reflect underlying pneumonia or solid. Pulmonary vascular congestion is essentially unchanged. An ET tube terminates approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Right-sided PICC terminates near the confluence of the right subclavian vein and right brachiocephalic vein.
