The right lower lung consolidation is overall unchanged or minimally improved from the most recent exam but new from the exam earlier yesterday, highly suggestive of aspiration/pneumonia. A retrocardiac opacity is new and may reflect aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting. Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema is mild but increased. The heart size is mildly enlarged, overall unchanged. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Mild emphysematous changes in the right upper lung.
