Semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube with its tip located at least 3.5 cm from the level of the carina, right upper extremity PICC with its tip in the mid SVC, and an NG tube, the tip of which is not seen below the level of the diaphragm. A dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter tip projects in the lower SVC. There is little change in low lung volumes, with linear atelectasis of the right lung base and improvement in retrocardiac atelectasis, which remains large. A left lower lobe nodular opacity likely reflects focal residual atelectasis. Surgical clips project over the gallbladder fossa. There is no pneumothorax, the cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is mild edema; pleural effusions are small if any.
