New spinal stabilization device in the cervicothoracic region. Change in the configuration of consolidation at the base of the left lung is suggestive of pneumonia than atelectasis. Mild edema is recognized in the right lower lobe. Left pleural effusion is small if any, alongside the displaced fractures of left middle ribs laterally, close to the diaphragm. There is no pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. Left subclavian catheter is been withdrawn to the proximal left brachiocephalic vein. Bilateral pleural drains are unchanged in their respective positions, both contiguous with the mediastinum, as before.
