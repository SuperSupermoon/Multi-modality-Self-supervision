AP chest compared to severe multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema developed and worsened simultaneously from ___ through ___. Subsequently, pulmonary edema has improved substantially, and consolidation has improved in some areas, but is still quite severe in the right upper lobe. Possibility of pulmonary hemorrhage as an alternative explanation for some of the consolidation should be entertained, as should the possibility of multiple pathogens, some respond to therapy, some not. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular congestion have both improved. ET tube, upper enteric drainage tube, are in standard placements. Transvenous right ventricular and left ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions. I do not see an atrial lead. Small pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax.
