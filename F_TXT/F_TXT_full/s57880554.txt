In comparison to the chest radiograph from yesterday, there is increased vascular congestion with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Increased hazy opacification at the right base is likely due to asymmetric edema. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The aorta is calcified and tortuous, and stable. The cardiac size is at the upper limits of normal.
