Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are multiple bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities worrisome for multifocal pneumonia. Trace blunting of the right costophrenic angle could be due to a trace right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable and the aortic knob is calcified.
