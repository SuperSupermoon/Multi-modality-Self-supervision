The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral lower lobe opacities with possible left-sided effusion. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Prominence of the hila could relate to vascular engorgement. A right-sided PICC line terminates with its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged. No pneumothorax is present.
