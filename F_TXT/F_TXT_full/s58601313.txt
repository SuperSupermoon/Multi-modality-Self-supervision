Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and appears somewhat globular in appearance, which could be due to an underlying pericardial effusion versus cardiomyopathy. Slight prominence and indistinctness of the hila may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement. No pneumothorax is seen. The aortic knob is calcified.
