Pleural catheters are present in the right hemithorax, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Pulmonary vascular congestion persists, but there has been improvement in the extent of pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities likely represent a combination of atelectasis and residual edema. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
