Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. Again seen are bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis, not significantly changed from the prior study. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged in appearance. There is no pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube ends 6.3 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. A right-sided Port-A-Cath ends at the right atrium. A left-sided central venous line ends at the mid SVC.
