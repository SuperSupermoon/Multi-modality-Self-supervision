The patient is rotated somewhat to the left. There has been interval placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating in the expected location of the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. In the interval since the prior study, there has been interval increase in opacity projecting over the left hemithorax, which may be due to underlying worsening atelectasis/effusion with associated consolidation which could be due to infection. Differntial diagnosis also includes hemorrhage. Air bronchograms are seen at the left lung base. Medial right base opacity is seen, which is likely confluence of vascular structures and the right aspect of the cardiac silhouette, although additional site of consolidation is not excluded. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.
