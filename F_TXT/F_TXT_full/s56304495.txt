The patient is status post sternotomy, with prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Due to underpenetration, the tip of the ET tube is not well delineated. It appears to lie in satisfactory position approximately 4.6 cm above the carina. No definite NG tube. A left subclavian central line tip overlies the distal SVC. No obvious pneumothorax. Hazy opacity at the right base likely reflects a small effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Partial interval clearing at the left base, but retrocardiac opacity and very hazy density persists. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with mild CHF. The patient's spinal hardware and sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips again noted.
