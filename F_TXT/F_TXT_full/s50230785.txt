Compared to ___ at 01:27 and allowing for technical differences, the medial left hemidiaphragm is slightly less distinct. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. An AICD type device and leads are unchanged. Abandoned leads also noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette with sternotomy wires, is unchanged. Background COPD with hyperinflation again noted. Patchy increased interstitial markings are present in both lungs. These could represent a combination of chronic fibrotic changes and/or superimposed edema. Again seen is blunting of both costophrenic angles. In this setting, superimposed infectious infiltrates would be difficult to exclude.
