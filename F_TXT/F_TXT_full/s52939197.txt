Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated to the left. There is minimal elevation of the left hemidiaphragm which may relate to patient positioning. Minimal left base atelectasis is seen. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is identified. Surgical clips are noted along the thyroid bed.
