As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed. The left PICC line is in unchanged position. The bolus changes at the right lung base are constant in appearance. There is new evidence of new focal parenchymal opacities suggesting new pneumonia. Minimal scarring around the bolus changes, however, persists. No pleural effusions.
