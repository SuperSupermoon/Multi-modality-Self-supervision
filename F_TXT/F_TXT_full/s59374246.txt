Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Nodular calcified structure projecting over the right lower lobe most likely represents calcified granuloma or relates to costochondral calcification. A calcified lymph node is again seen in the AP window. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Evidence of hiatal hernia is again seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
