Cardiomediastinal contours demonstrate left ventricular configuration of the heart and slight tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Apparent rightward deviation of the trachea is apparently due to marked rightward rotation of the patient's neck. The lungs are well expanded and grossly clear except for linear foci of atelectasis or scar in the left mid and lower lung regions. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
