A semi upright portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea and an enteric tube which terminates just distal to the GE junction. There are low lung volumes, as before. The heart is likely normal in size, allowing for exaggeration due to low lung volumes. Bilateral pulmonary opacities are increased compared to the most recent chest radiograph. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
