Low bilateral lung volumes. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but this may be secondary to magnification from the AP technique and low lung volumes. The tracheal stent again is noted to project over the thoracic inlet.
