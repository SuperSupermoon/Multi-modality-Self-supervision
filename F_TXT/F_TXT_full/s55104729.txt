A PICC line terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins of the superior vena cava, and the patient is again status post tracheostomy. The heart appears enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is a diffuse mild vascular prominence with indistinct vascular and interstitial markings suggesting mild congestion. Patchy retrocardiac opacity is minor and probably attributable to atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion although noting that the left costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
