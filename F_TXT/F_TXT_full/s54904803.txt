Chest x-ray dated ___ at 4:20 a.m. There is rotated positioning. A rounded density with denser rim lies in the right paratracheal region. I suspect this represents some sort of artifact and is not related to the aortic knob. There is moderately severe cardiomegaly. This appears more pronounced than on the prior film, but could relate to technical differences. The "water bottle" configuration of the cardiac silhouette on today's exam raises the possibility of some pericardial fluid. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, slightly more pronounced. There is minimal patchy opacity at both lung bases, overall similar to the prior study, allowing for technical differences. No new area of consolidation and no effusion are detected.
