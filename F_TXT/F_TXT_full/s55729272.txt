Marked interval improved aeration of the left lung, which was previously nearly completely opacified, with residual airspace opacities most prominent in the central, perihilar and left retrocardiac regions. The degree of volume loss in the left hemithorax is also improved with some residual shift to the left. Within the right lung, poorly defined opacities in the right upper lobe and right infrahilar region have slightly worsened. Otherwise, no relevant short interval change since recent radiograph.
