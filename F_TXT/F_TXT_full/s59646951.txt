Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is approximately 6 cm above the carina. The patient is substantially rotated which precludes assessment of the chest. Within those limitations, there is most likely no change in the right pleural effusion, moderate and no evidence of pulmonary edema. The patient is most likely after placement of interatrial septal defect closure device. The left internal jugular line and the right internal jugular line are in appropriate positions.
