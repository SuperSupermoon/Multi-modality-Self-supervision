Right PICC seen with tip in the right atrium and could be retracted 3 cm for positioning closer to the cavoatrial junction. Left-sided central venous catheter with configuration near the tip likely due to its course within the azygos vein. Endotracheal tube tip 2.4 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the field of view. Appearance of the lungs again notable for bibasilar opacities.
