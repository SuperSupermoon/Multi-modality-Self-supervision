The heart is again markedly enlarged. The left lung base is opacified, which is difficult to assess in greater detail, but may reflect pleural effusion, possibly with atelectasis or even pneumonia. There is probably at least a trace pleural effusion on the right. There is increased perihilar fullness bilaterally suggesting mild vascular congestion. A new opacity in the right lower lung is relatively focal and potentially indicates pneumonia. An atypical distribution of pulmonary edema could also be considered, however. Moderate rightward spinal curvature is centered along the lower thoracic spine.
