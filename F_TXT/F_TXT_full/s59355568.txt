1. Left-sided pacer remains in place. Heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation on the current study. There has been interval slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, where there is now patchy opacity which may reflect atelectasis, although an early infectious process should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Prominent interstitium likely reflects age-related changes. No pneumothorax. Radiopaque material projecting over one of the upper lumbar vertebrae is again seen consistent with prior vertebroplasty. Mild gaseous distention of the stomach.
