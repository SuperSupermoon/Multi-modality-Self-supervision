Left-sided chest tube remains in place, with persistent abrupt angulation of the tube course at the level of the side port. Large partially loculated left pleural effusion is not appreciably changed, nor are adjacent multifocal lung parenchymal opacities in the left lung. In the right lung, mild interstitial edema is present as well as a mild-to-moderate layering right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
