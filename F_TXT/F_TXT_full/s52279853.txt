There has been interval development of right perihilar and right basilar opacities and to lesser extent left base opacity raising concern for multifocal pneumonia, versus asymmetric pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen although there may be a trace left pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable. Calcification is seen at the aortic knob.
