Left subclavian central venous catheter is again seen with tip in the region of the proximal right atrium. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There are perihilar opacities which may be due to fluid overload. Additional left perihilar mid lung opacity is seen which could relate to fluid overload, although underlying infectious process is not excluded, or even aspiration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
