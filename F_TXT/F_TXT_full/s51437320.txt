The patient is slightly rotated. The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours remain within normal limits. An endotracheal tube terminates 5.6 cm above the carina. There is a left IJ central venous catheter terminating at the brachiocephalic vein. A right IJ terminates at the mid SVC. There is no focal consolidation. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. A lucency extends from the left lung laterally to below the expected location of the left costophrenic angle. This is likely related to rotated positioning, however underlying pneumothorax cannot be entirely excluded. A dedicated upright radiograph or short-term follow-up radiographs could be considered.
