Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with tip terminating 5 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. New left retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or developing infectious pneumonia. Subtle branching opacities in right lower lobe may correspond to small airways disease pattern in this region on recent CTA of the chest of ___, suggesting that aspiration or evolving aspiration pneumonia as a likely cause for these radiographic findings. Fibronodular left apical pleuroparenchymal opacities are not well evaluated by this chest radiograph but have been more fully characterized on the CTA of the chest of two days earlier. Probable small left pleural effusion, but no visible pneumothorax.
