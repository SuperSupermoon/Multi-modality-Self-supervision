An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. Right PICC line tip terminates in lower SVC. An enteric tube projects over the expected location of the stomach, tip is not included in this examination. Lung volumes remain low. There is interstitial edema, mild in the right hemithorax and more prominent on the left, likely asymmetric edema. There is evidence of cardiac decompensation with dilation of azygos vein and pulmonary vessels. There is no definite pneumothorax. As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, interval worsening of left perihilar opacity is concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. This finding however, may also be related to asymmetric edema.
