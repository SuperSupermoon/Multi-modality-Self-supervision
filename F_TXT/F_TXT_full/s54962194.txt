A right PICC is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the low SVC. The inspiratory lung volumes remain low and slightly decreased from the most recent prior study. Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions are unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected, although irregular vertically oriented linear densities project over the right hemithorax, which likely represent material external to the patient. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is stable. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and calcification of the aortic arch. The left hilus appears prominent, which is unchanged from the prior study. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable. Moderate to severe degenerative change is noted in the right shoulder joint.
