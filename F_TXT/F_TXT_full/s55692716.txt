1. Heart remains enlarged. Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. There is calcification and unfolding of the aorta, consistent with atherosclerosis. Layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities, likely consistent with compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Persistent prominence of the right perihilar vasculature suggests an element of congestion. No evidence of pneumothorax.
