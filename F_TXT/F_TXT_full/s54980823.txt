Lungs are without focal consolidation. No bibasilar opacities are likely to reflect atelectasis. Low lung volumes are noted. There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The heart is moderately enlarged as before with fullness of the azygous vein suggesting an elevated central venous pressure.
