AP chest compared to ___ and ___: There is probably at least a moderate right pleural effusion. Lung bases are of greater radio opacity than the upper lungs. On the right, this could be due in part to the effusion, but there is a suggestion of peribronchial opacification even frank consolidation in the infrahilar right lower lobe. On the left, the abnormality looks like vascular engorgement and perhaps the earlier stage of interstitial edema. It would be very helpful to obtain conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs of this patient. Heart size is top normal. There is no pneumothorax.
