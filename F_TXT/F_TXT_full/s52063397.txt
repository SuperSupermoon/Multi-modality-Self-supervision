Tracheostomy tube extends at least as far as the proximal right main bronchus which may account for persistent left lower lobe collapse. Mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement suggest a component of cardiac decompensation, though mild cardiomegaly is exaggerated by low lung volumes. Pleural effusion is small, on the left if any. No pneumothorax.
