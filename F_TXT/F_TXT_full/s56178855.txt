A portable semi-upright chest radiograph is slightly underpenetrated in technique, however, there appears to be no improvement, and a possible slight increase, in airspace haziness in the lower lung zones bilaterally. On the right, this is obscuring the hemidiaphragm. Positioning of supporting lines and tubes is unchanged, and note is made that the right-sided PICC line is in midline, approximately at the level of the cephalic vein.
