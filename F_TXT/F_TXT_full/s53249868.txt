The endotracheal tube remains in the mid trachea. A left subclavian central line terminates in the lower SVC. An NG tube terminates below the diaphragm within the stomach. Compared to the prior study, there is new opacity in the right mid and lower lung fields likely representing increasing layering pleural effusion. The left base appears better aerated compared to the prior study. Again seen is pulmonary vascular congestion compatible with mild fluid overload. Multifocal and poorly defined nodular opacities are present. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
