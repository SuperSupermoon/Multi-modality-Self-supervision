A right-sided central venous catheter is in unchanged position, terminating at the mid SVC. There is persistent opacification of the right lung base, likely secondary to moderate sized pleural effusion. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely secondary to a small pleural effusion. Widening of the upper mediastinum correlates with lymphadenopathy and soft tissue density within the mediastinum as seen on prior CT. No definite pneumothorax seen on this portable semi-erect chest radiograph. Pulmonary edema has slightly improved, now mild.
