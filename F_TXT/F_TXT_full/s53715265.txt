As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change in appearance of the cardiac silhouette. The left lung is better ventilated than on the previous film, but left lower lobe collapse and left pleural effusion persists. On the right, a small pleural effusion is visually more evident than on the previous image. The previous signs of the pulmonary edema have decreased substantially. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Constant sternal fixation material.
