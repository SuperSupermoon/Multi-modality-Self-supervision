1. Interval placement of a feeding tube which courses below the diaphragm and the tip is not identified. Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are increasing effusions, now seen bilaterally, left greater than right. No evidence of pulmonary edema. There are patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis in the setting of an effusion, although an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax.
