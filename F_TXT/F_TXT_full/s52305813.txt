PA and lateral chest compared to ___ through ___: Endotracheal tube ends at the thoracic inlet, no less than 8.5 cm from the carina. It should be advanced for more secured seating, if possible. An upper enteric drainage tube passes into non-distended stomach and out of view. Hyperinflation suggests emphysema, but this is relatively mild on the chest CT performed elsewhere on ___, which incidentally shows heavy asbestos-related pleural plaques and extensive bronchial secretions, nearly occluding the airway in the left lower lobe bronchial tree. There is no pneumonia. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC. The cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
