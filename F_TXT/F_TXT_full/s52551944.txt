Dense left mid lung airspace opacification may represent a superior subsegment left lower lobe pneumonia or parenchymal mass. Nodular densities project over the lungs bilaterally consistent with pleural plaques related to prior asbestos exposure. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with trace pulmonary edema. There is probably a small right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is mild to moderate. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable. Bilateral glenohumeral degenerative changes are partially assessed.
