AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained five hours earlier during the same day. During the examination interval, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been withdrawn, but the right internal jugular approach sheath remains in place. No pneumothorax has developed. The previously described chest tubes advanced from below remain in place. No evidence of increased pleural effusions and no new parenchymal infiltrates are seen. The moderate enlargement of the heart shadow remains now stable and has not increased further since the other postoperative chest examinations. In none of the postoperative portable chest examination after the latest operation was any striking mediastinal widening reported. Increase of the heart shadow postoperatively was observed already on the first examination and remains now stable. Review of the patient's data indicates that the hematocrit had dropped from preoperative ___ to about ___ in conjunction with the operation, but is now again on the way up and reached values of 28 at the time of the latest chest x-ray.
