As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressures. As a consequence, the extent and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities has minimally decreased. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
