Widespread air space opacities have developed throughout the right lung, and are accompanied by a moderate sized right pleural effusion. Considering recent procedural history, the lung opacities could potentially represent acute aspiration, hemorrhage or edema. Left lung is grossly clear. Right juxtahilar mass appears similar to the prior study, with associated proximal airway obstruction and right lower lobe atelectasis.
