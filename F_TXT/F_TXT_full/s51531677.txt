AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. An NG tube can be identified and although nondetectable in the lower esophagus related to cardiac motion, one can see the distal NG tube to reach well in the stomach where it is curved up in the fundus and the tip pointing towards the pylorus. There is no pneumothorax or any other possibly placement-related complication. The on previous examination still persisting left lower lobe pulmonary parenchymal densities, interpreted as atelectasis or possible aspiration pneumonitis, has improved. No new abnormalities are seen. The position of the previously described right internal jugular approach central venous line is unchanged.
