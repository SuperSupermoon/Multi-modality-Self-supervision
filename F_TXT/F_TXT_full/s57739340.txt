Single PA upright portable view of the chest was obtained. In the interval since the prior study, there has been placement of a left-sided chest tube, terminating in the medial left lower hemithorax, with significant decrease in left pneumothorax with possibly a tiny left apical pneumothorax remaining. The lungs remain hyperinflated. There is left base retrocardiac streaky opacity. This may represent atelectasis. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Multiple old left-sided rib deformities are again noted. Surgical clips overlie the lateral right lower hemithorax.
