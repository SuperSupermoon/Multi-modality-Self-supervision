In comparison to the prior radiograph from earlier the same date, the left lung has substantially re-expanded with residual atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Interval intubation with tip of endotracheal tube approximately 2 cm above the carina, and placement of nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm. Atelectasis involving the right middle and right lower lobes has partially improved. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by improving edema. Moderate left and small to moderate right pleural effusions are present.
