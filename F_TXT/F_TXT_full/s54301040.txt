There has been interval retraction of a left approach PICC with tip now in the mid SVC. An enteric tube traverses below the diaphragm with weighted tip in the stomach. The lungs remain low in volume, accentuating peribronchovascular crowding. The heart is top normal in size allowing for low lung volumes and AP technique. There is likely minimal subsegmental atelectasis in the left base. There is no pneumothorax or large effusion.
