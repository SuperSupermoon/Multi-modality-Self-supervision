Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. The tip of the endotracheal tube resides approximately 4 cm above the carina. The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen, tip excluded from view. There is consolidation at the left lung base which likely represents a combination of effusion and possibly aspiration/atelectasis. The right lung appears grossly clear. Heart size cannot be readily assessed. Mediastinal contour appears normal. A right humeral head replacement is noted. Degenerative changes are severe at the left glenohumeral joint.
