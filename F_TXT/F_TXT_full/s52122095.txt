The lungs are well expanded. Mildly increased interstitial markings likely reflect mild chronic interstitial disease. Atelectasis is seen in the lung bases bilaterally. Trace bilateral pleural effusions likely present. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to prior exam. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.
