As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung bases have both minimally increased in radiolucency. This might reflect a decrease in pleural effusions or improved ventilation. However, the size of the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and signs of mild to moderate pulmonary edema are visualized. No new focal parenchymal opacities. The retrocardiac atelectasis is constant in extent and severity. A 3 mm calcified granuloma, projecting over the first rib on the right, might be present.
