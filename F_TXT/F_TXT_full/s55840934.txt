AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar portable chest examination obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, a Dobbhoff line has been placed, seen to reach well below the diaphragm where it is curved up in the fundus of the stomach. Chest findings have not undergone any significant interval change and again demonstrate the presence of moderate cardiac enlargement with low air volumes in the lungs and somewhat plethoric appearance of the pulmonary vasculature, but no evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema.
