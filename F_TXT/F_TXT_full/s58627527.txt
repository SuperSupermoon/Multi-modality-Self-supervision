Endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube terminates just distal to the GE junction and should be advanced 5-6 cm for ideal positioning. A right internal jugular catheter is in unchanged position and terminates in the distal SVC. The lung volumes are markedly low. Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right likely reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
