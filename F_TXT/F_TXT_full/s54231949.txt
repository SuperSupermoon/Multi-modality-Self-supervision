Lung volumes are lower due to new small posteriorly layering pleural effusions and mild left basal atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged but the heart is normal size and mediastinal veins are not dilated. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements.
