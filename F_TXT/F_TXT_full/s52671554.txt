The lung volume is small. Bilateral lower lobe opacities have increased compared to prior, more on the left. The right opacity is more likely atelectasis. Although the left lower lobe opacities do not obscure the left heart border or left hemidiaphragm, pneumonia cannot be ruled out. A lateral chest radiograph could provide more definitive information. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The hila and pulmonary vasculature are normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
