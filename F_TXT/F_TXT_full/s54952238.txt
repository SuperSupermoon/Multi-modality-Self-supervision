There are low lung volumes. Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with aortic knob calcifications present. Linear opacity within the left lung base most likely reflects atelectasis. However, more focal consolidative opacity in the retrocardiac region is nonspecific and could represent atelectasis or infection. Small left pleural effusion appears new compared to the prior exam. Right lung base also demonstrates mild atelectatic changes. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Expansile lesion within the anterior right fifth rib is unchanged. Previously noted subacute fractures of the right inferior ribs are not clearly demonstrated on the current exam.
