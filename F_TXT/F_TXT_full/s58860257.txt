Endotracheal tube is in standard position, but a nasogastric tube terminates in the lower thoracic esophagus, with side port in the mid thoracic region. Dr. ___ has been telephoned with this result at 7:45 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Worsening asymmetrically distributed areas of airspace opacification are present, located in the left mid and both lower lung regions. These findings likely represent progressive multifocal pneumonia, but a component of co-existing pulmonary edema is possible. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
