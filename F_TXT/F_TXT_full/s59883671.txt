AP portable upright view of the chest. Due to marked scoliosis of the upper T-spine, appearance of the chest is somewhat distorted. Allowing for this, there is no convincing evidence for pneumonia, effusion or pneumothorax. Mild interstitial edema difficult to exclude given subtle interstitial prominence. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged with mild cardiomegaly and unfolded thoracic aorta. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
