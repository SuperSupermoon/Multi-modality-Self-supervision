Tip of the right subclavian PICC line is in the lower portion of the SVC. Some increased opacification at the right base is consistent with atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. There is extensive opacification in the right renal collecting system, presumably from recent study.
