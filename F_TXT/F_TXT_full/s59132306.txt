Again seen is left IJ central line with tip over mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Calcified nodule at the right lung base, presumably a calcified granuloma, is unchanged.
