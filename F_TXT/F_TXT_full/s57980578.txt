Minnesota tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Balloons are not clearly identified. Large bore right supraclavicular central venous catheter ends in the upper right atrium. Left jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC. Lung volumes are quite low, atelectasis is severe on the left, mild to moderate on the right, both worsened. Low lung volumes exaggerate moderate cardiomegaly. Pulmonary edema is mild if any. No pneumothorax.
