There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is too low and pointing towards the right mainstem bronchus. The tip is only 9 mm above the carina. This could be pulled back 3-4 cm for more optimal placement. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings without overt pulmonary edema. There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusions. There are no pneumothoraces.
