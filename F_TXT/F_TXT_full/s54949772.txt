Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, including bilateral chest tubes, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to patient rotation but are probably stable allowing for this factor. Worsening opacity in left retrocardiac region is likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Mild perihilar haziness is attributed to edema, and a patchy infrahilar opacity on the right could reflect dependent edema, atelectasis or aspiration.
