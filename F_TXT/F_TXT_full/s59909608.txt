Single portable view of the chest. Appearance of the right lung is unchanged with surgical chain sutures adjacent to the hilum underlying fibrotic changes in overall right hemithorax volume loss suggestive of prior lobectomy. Although the left lung is partially obscured due to overlying oxygenation mask and cardiac leads, there are multifocal regions of consolidation throughout the lung. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Atherosclerotic calcifications again seen at the aortic arch. Bilateral shoulder arthroplasties are identified.
