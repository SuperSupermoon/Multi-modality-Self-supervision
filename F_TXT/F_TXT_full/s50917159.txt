As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the right chest tube, the nasogastric tube and the left PICC line are unchanged. There is a minimal decrease in extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion. The right lung shows an unchanged appearance with status post multiple partly displaced rib fractures, a mild pleural effusion and absence of pneumothorax.
