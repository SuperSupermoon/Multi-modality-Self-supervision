There is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion with basilar compressive atelectasis, which obscures the right hemidiaphragm and layers posteriorly. There does not appear to be a left-sided pleural effusion, although assessment is incomplete without lateral image. There is stable moderate cardiomegaly. There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. A Dobbhoff feeding tube can be seen traversing the esophagus and entering the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
