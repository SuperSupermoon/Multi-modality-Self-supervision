In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarseness of interstitial markings, consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. Blunting of the costophrenic angles with atelectatic streaks at the base is again seen. An cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Prominence of interstitial markings most likely reflects a combination of chronic pulmonary disease and elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
