On the right, there has been interval placement of a chest tube projecting over the right hemithorax. There is a new small quantity of subcutaneous emphysema associated with tube placement and a small pneumothorax. Vague opacity in the left upper the right upper lung is more suggestive of atelectasis than a substantial effusion. The right-sided effusion is probably still fairly small at most and may have been evacuated. The left lung remains clear. The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
