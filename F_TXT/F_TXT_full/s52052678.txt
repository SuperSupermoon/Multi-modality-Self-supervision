Large right pleural effusion has further increased in size and now occupies the entirety of the right hemithorax, with associated leftward shift of the cardiomediastinal contours. Hemothorax should be considered if the patient has had recent intervention, trauma or has known coagulation disorder. Left lung and pleural surfaces are grossly clear allowing for some crowding of bronchovascular structures related to the leftward cardiomediastinal shift.
