An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip 5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the left upper quadrant. The lung volumes remain low. Parenchymal opacities bilaterally are significantly increased in the left lung from the most recent prior study performed 5 hours earlier. Small pleural effusions are likely present. No pneumothorax is seen although there is an air-fluid level in the left lung base. The pulmonary vasculature is engorged. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. The left hilus is obscured by diffuse parenchymal opacities.
