The right IJ catheter has been removed. Lung volumes appear slightly lower compared to the prior study, which exaggerates bronchovascular markings. Increased perihilar opacity on the right may represent worsening vascular congestion exaggerated by a low lung volumes, although a superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Dense left retrocardiac opacity has improved, likely reflecting resolving atelectasis. There is suggestion of a small layering pleural effusion on the left. No pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. No acute osseous abnormalities. Right hemidiaphragm is newly elevated from ___.
