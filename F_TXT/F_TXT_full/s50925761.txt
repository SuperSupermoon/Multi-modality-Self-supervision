Lung volumes remain low and there are streaky residual opacities at both bases, left more than right, which overall have slightly improved suggesting resolving atelectasis or pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax or large effusions. Mild degenerative changes seen involving the right glenohumeral joint. The left humeral head has a somewhat mottled appearance on the current study possibly related to degenerative change and patchy osteopenia due to the positioning, although an acute process cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is recommended.
