Portable AP chest radiograph. The right pigtail catheter has been removed and replaced with a right chest tube which terminates in standard position. The lung has re-expanded and minimal, if any, air remains in the pleural cavity. Bibasilar opacifications consistent with pneumonia are unchanged. Subcutaneous emphysema tracking along the right hemithorax into the supraclavicular fossa is again noted. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
