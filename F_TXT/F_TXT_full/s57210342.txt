Since earlier same day chest radiograph, the tip of a new endotracheal tube is seen 0.8 cm above the carina. Worsening of left retrocardiac atelectasis is noted with stable bilateral small pleural effusions. Lung volumes remain low. Top-normal heart size is accentuated by low lung volumes. Prominence of right hilus is likely due to scarring and atelectasis, better seen on reference CT chest.
