In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by worsening mild pulmonary edema. Patient rotation somewhat limits comparison, but note is made of an proving left basilar and worsening right basilar opacities and apparent decrease in size of left pleural effusion. No other relevant change.
