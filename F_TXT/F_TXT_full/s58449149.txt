There is interval placement of an endotracheal tube with tip 2 cm above the carina. The endotracheal tube could approximate choroid if the patient's neck is flexed and should not be advanced further. Left subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the origin of the SVC. The Doppler tip is in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Mild diffuse bilateral pulmonary interstitial edema and moderate layering bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left are overall unchanged. No pneumothorax.
