Right-sided chest tube has been replaced or repositioned, now terminating adjacent to the medial aspect of the right hemidiaphragm. Basilar right hydropneumothorax is probably unchanged compared to the previous exam. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema persists as well as cervical emphysema continuous with pneumomediastinum. Bilateral heterogeneous lung opacities have slightly improved since the previous radiograph. No new or worsening areas of lung opacification are evident.
