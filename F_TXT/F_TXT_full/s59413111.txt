PA and lateral chest compared to ___: Atelectasis and asymmetric pulmonary edema are improving. Residual edema is mild, accompanied by small right pleural effusion. Cardiomegaly is moderate-to-severe, and the configuration of the heart suggests both left atrial enlargement and enlarged pulmonary outflow tract along with enlarged right pulmonary artery in the setting of pulmonary arterial pressure elevation. Previous left pleural effusion is no longer evident. With the chin down, the position of the endotracheal tube, 2 cm from the carina is acceptable. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right main pulmonary artery. Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular defibrillator leads follow their expected courses. No pneumothorax.
