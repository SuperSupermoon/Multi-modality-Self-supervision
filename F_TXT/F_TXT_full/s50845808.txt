As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, causing an increase of basal areas of atelectasis and a crowding of vascular structures. The small pre-existing pleural effusions are constant in appearance. The lung volumes remain overall very low. The right PICC line is in unchanged position.
