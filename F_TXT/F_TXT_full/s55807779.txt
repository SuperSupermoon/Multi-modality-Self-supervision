An ET tube is in place, tip above the level of the clavicular heads, approximately 5.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A right IJ PICC line is present, tip at the confluence of subclavian and brachiocephalic veins, in the region of the proximal-most SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Compared with earlier the same day, much of the left mid and lower zones of the left lung remain dense opacified. However, there has been some degree of interval aeration in the mid zone laterally, extending into the left lung apex. Mild residual hazy opacity is seen in the left upper and lateral left mid zones. Allowing for rotated positioning, no definite leftward shift of the mediastinum is identified, though subtle displacement would be difficult to completely exclude. In the right lung, there is vascular plethora and atelectasis, slightly increased, without frank consolidation or gross effusion.
