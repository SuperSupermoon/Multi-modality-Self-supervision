AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Patient has been extubated, and lung volumes are appreciably lower compared to ___. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are larger, and there is more left basal atelectasis. I see no pneumothorax. The stomach is now moderately distended with air following removal of the upper enteric drainage tube. Lower lung volumes and the termination of positive pressure ventilation explain in part increase in the diameter of the cardiac silhouette, but intravascular volume has probably also increased. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery. Right subclavian line ends low in the SVC. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements. Midline and left pleural drains still in place. ___ was paged at 4:46 p.m. and we discussed the findings by telephone at 4:50 p.m.
