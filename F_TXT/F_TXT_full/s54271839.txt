Small right pleural effusion has decreased, draining through the right pigtail pleural catheter. Left lower lobe is still collapsed, probably due to retained secretions accompanied by moderate, increasing left pleural effusion. Severe cardiomegaly is long-standing. No esophagus is chronically distended with air. Upper trachea is chronically displaced the right by goiter in the left lobe of the thyroid. There is no Pneumothorax.
