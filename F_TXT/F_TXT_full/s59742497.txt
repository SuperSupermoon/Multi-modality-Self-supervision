A single frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar opacities are seen, which may represent a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis or hemorrhage in the setting of trauma. The patient's known rib fractures are not well seen on this study. Per the ED notes, the patient has an outside CT scan, which has not yet been uploaded for reference. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by the bilateral opacities.
