Compared to the prior film, there is a new or repositioned enteric tube. The radiopaque tip and side-port overlie the expected location of the gastric fundus. The extreme distal portion of the radiopaque tip extends beyond the inferior edge of this film. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
