Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a new opacity in the right upper lobe likely representing hemorrhage status post bronchoscopic biopsy or, if a lavage was performed, this could also represent a post-lavage appearance. There is no pneumothorax seen. Diffuse interstitial opacities are seen, consistent with mild interstitial edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen. There is mild cardiomegaly, stable from previous imaging. Pacer is in left anterior axillary position with intact leads in the expected course to the right atrium and right ventricle. Sternotomy wires and CABG clips are again seen.
