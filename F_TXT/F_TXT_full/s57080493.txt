Tracheostomy tube is approximately 2 cm above the level of the carina and is in appropriate position. Right IJ tip is in low SVC. NG tube extends into proximal stomach and is out of view. Mild interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. Increased mild pulmonary edema with mediastinal vein dilatation and mildly enlarged heart which is slightly accentuated by low lung volumes. Linear rounded opacity in the right lower lobe is likely from atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Severe degenerative change at the right humeral head is again noted.
