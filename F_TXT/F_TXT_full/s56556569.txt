An endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carinal. A nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. The lung volumes are very low which causes crowding of bronchovascular structures and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion identified. Considering patient positioning, the mediastinum is likely normal.
