1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina. There is a nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. A right chest tube remains in place. There has been interval removal of the left chest tube. There is a diffuse bilateral airspace process which would be concerning for pulmonary hemorrhage or aspiration given the patient's recent history of trauma. Pulmonary edema or diffuse pneumonia would be less likely. A linear lucency at the right apex may reflect the known small right apical pneumothorax, although given supine technique, this would be an unusual position and therefore, this suggests that it may be loculated. No large effusions. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No large left pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Avulsion fracture of the right humeral greater tuberosity confirmed and raises concern for rotator cuff injury. Results were communicated to the patient's nurse, ___ on ___ by phone at 9:55 a.m. at the time of discovery.
