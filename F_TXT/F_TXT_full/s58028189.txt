The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Generalized opacification has improved somewhat suggesting reduction in fluid overload, but on this examination there is a developing opacity projecting over the right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe. There is still a substantial nodular focus projecting over the left mid lung and possibly a second one projecting nearby. The right mid-to-lower lung is difficult to assess for any possible nodules.
