Dobbhoff tube terminates in the region of the duodenojejunal junction. Within the imaged portion of the chest, cardiac silhouette appears smaller than on the prior study, with associated resolution of pulmonary edema and apparent resolution of pleural effusions as well. Band-like focus of atelectasis is present in the left juxtahilar and retrocardiac region, with otherwise grossly clear lungs, although exclusion of lung apices limits assessment of these regions.
