The overall appearance of the chest is not significantly changed from the most recent prior study. Widespread dense opacities projecting over the lungs and along the bilateral hemidiaphragms are compatible with calcified pleural plaques. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema is unchanged. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but stable. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. The patient is status post median sternotomy. A vascular graft compatible with a CoreValve projects over the aortic root. Calcification at the aortic knob is noted. Surgical clips along the right lower neck are also noted.
