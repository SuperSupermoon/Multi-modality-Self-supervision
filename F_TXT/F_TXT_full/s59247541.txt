Bilateral upper lobe volume loss and upper lung predominant pleural and parenchymal fibrosis could potentially be due to previous radiation therapy given history of lymphoma. Marked interval decrease in size of left pleural effusion with residual small pleural effusion remaining. Asymmetrical left apicolateral pleural opacity could reflect loculated fluid and/or thickening. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance in this patient with known residual soft tissue abnormality in the anterior mediastinum. A few scattered septal lines are present in the right lower lung and may reflect mild interstitial edema. Note is also made of a small right pleural effusion. Considering clinical suspicion for infection, a standard PA and lateral chest radiograph within the department may be helpful to more fully evaluate for subtle area of pneumonia in this patient with complex lung parenchymal and pleural abnormalities.
