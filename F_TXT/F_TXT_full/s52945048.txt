1. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning and technique. Previously described more focal areas of nodularity in the right lung are not appreciated on the current examination and most likely represented superimposed shadows. 3 mm left mid lung radiopaque nodule most likely reflects a calcified granuloma. Overall, no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia, although biapical streaky opacities are seen possibly representing chronic changes possibly related to prior aspiration. Comparison to more remote studies would be helpful to assess for stability. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are consistent with previous cholecystectomy. Soft tissue opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle most likely reflects a benign process, possibly a prominent cardiac fat pad. Comparison to more remote studies would be extremely helpful to assess for stability.
