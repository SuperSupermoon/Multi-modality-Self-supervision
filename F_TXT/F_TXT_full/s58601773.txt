Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a left pectoral dual-channel pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. New since preceding exam is a large right-sided pleural effusion with dense consolidation in the right lower lobe and likely also right middle lobe. This could represent a component of atelectasis, but concurrent infection cannot be excluded. There are several more linear areas of subsegmental atelectasis in the right upper lung. The left lung is relatively well aerated. There is no large left pleural effusion. The heart is likely enlarged but suboptimally assessed. The thoracic aorta is mildly unfolded, with arch calcifications. Multilevel lumbar spondylosis is present.
