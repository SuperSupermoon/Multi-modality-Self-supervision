1. A single-lead left-sided pacing device is in place with the lead terminating over the expected location of the right ventricle. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The left apical pneumothorax has decreased in size with no definite pneumothorax on the current study. Heart remains stably enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. No evidence of pulmonary edema, focal airspace consolidation or pleural effusions. Streaky linear opacities at the left base most likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis or post-inflammatory scarring.
