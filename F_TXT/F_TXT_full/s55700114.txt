1. Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the proximal right atrium. An endotracheal tube has its tip 3.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There are layering effusions, left much greater than right, and the pulmonary vasculature appears ill-defined, which likely reflects an element of superimposed mild pulmonary edema. More patchy opacity in the right mid lung and in the left lower lobe could reflect compressive atelectasis, although a superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax.
