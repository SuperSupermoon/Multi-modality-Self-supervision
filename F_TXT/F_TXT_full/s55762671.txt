Nasogastric tube is again seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina and is now in satisfactory position. Patchy opacities are now seen at both bases which may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration and early pneumonia should also be considered. No obvious pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
