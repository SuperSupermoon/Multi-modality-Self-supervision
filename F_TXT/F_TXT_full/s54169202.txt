Right pleural catheter remains in place, with marked decrease in size of right pneumothorax with small residual lateral pneumothorax remaining. Left-sided chest tube also remains in place with apparent resolution of apical component of left pneumothorax, but there is a likely residual loculated pneumothorax adjacent to the chest tube site. Moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis are unchanged. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, in keeping with known pericardial effusion. There is a questionable new small right pleural effusion.
