A moderate-sized right pneumothorax is present with chest tube in place, and the pneumothorax has slightly increased in size since the prior radiograph. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated throughout the right chest wall, but also in both supraclavicular and cervical regions. A small amount of contiguous pneumomediastinum is present, especially in the superior mediastinum. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Interval improvement in left lower lobe atelectasis with minor left basilar atelectasis and small adjacent pleural effusion. Within the right lung, patchy atelectasis at the right lung base is again visualized. Marked volume loss in the left hemithorax is due to prior left upper lobe and partial chest wall resection.
