There is a new left internal jugular central venous catheter terminating at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins to form the superior vena cava. The patient remains intubated. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appears stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Lung parenchyma has continued to improve in terms of aeration. The only area of increased opacification is right infrahilar opacity that slightly obscures the right medial heart border suggesting that there may be increased right middle or lower lobe opacity, developing pneumonia or atelectasis. Reassessment with short-term followup radiographs is suggested.
