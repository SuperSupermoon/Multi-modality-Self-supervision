Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest. The lung volumes are low. There is some blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus likely in the setting of atelectasis and small pleural effusion. The heart size is exaggerated by AP technique and is most likely top normal, stable. There is no pneumothorax. No new airspace opacity is seen to suggest pneumonia. There is crowding of central pulmonary vasculature, but no frank pulmonary edema.
