1. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. The right subclavian PICC line now takes an acute angle with approximately 3 cm of the distal portion coursing horizontally to the midline suggesting that the tip may now lie in the left brachiocephalic vein. Re-positioning would be recommended. The heart remains enlarged. There is persistent layering left effusion with associated consolidation in the retrocardiac region likely representing partial left lower lobe atelectasis. Overall, the lung volumes remain low, and the pulmonary edema has resolved. Previously questioned cavitary area in the suprahilar right lung is no longer appreciated and therefore did in fact represent superimposed shadows. No pneumothorax. Results were communicated to the patient's nurse, ___, by phone on ___ at 8:35 a.m. at the time of discovery. The recommendation is to pull back the PICC line by approximately 3 cm in order to have the tip be in the proximal SVC.
