Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with results in bronchovascular crowding. There has been interval development of a small left-sided pleural effusion with significant adjacent atelectasis. There is increased right basilar atelectasis as well. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Chest tubes project over the bilateral hemithoraces. No pneumothorax.
