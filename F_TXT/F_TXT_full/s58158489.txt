1. Left-sided pacer and right pigtail pleural catheter remain in place. There is interval improvement in aeration at the right lung base, with overall decrease in size of the pleural effusion. There is a stable left pleural effusion with associated patchy airspace disease, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning and rotation between studies. Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion with no evidence of pulmonary edema on the current study. Residual contrast is seen within the visualized colon.
