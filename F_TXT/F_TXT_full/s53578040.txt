Single portable view of the chest. No prior. There are bibasilar opacities which silhouette the hemidiaphragms, right greater than left suggestive of pleural effusions. Indistinctness of pulmonary vascular markings with cephalization also seen. Cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged but is difficult to assess given bibasilar opacities. Degenerative changes noted at the shoulders bilaterally. Osseous and soft tissue structures otherwise grossly unremarkable.
