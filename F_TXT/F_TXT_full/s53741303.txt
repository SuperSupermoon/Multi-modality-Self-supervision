Compared with the prior film, no obvious change is detected involving the right lung. Again seen is a right chest tube, with some stable blunting of the right costophrenic angle and overall decreased size of the right chest, with multiple rib fractures again noted. No obvious pneumothorax is identified. Markings in the right chest are similar to the prior film, without frank, focal consolidation. There is a small left effusion, which is slight increased compared with the prior film, and minimal atelectasis at the left lung base, similar to the prior film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly enlarged, but appears slightly decreased in size compared to the prior film. It remains midline. Tortuous aorta is unchanged. Azygos vein is probably decreased in size. Apparent interval removal of an epidural catheter. The current film includes the AC joint, which is clearly separated, with elevation of the distal clavicle with respect to the acromion and associated widening of the AC joint and coracoclavicular interval.
