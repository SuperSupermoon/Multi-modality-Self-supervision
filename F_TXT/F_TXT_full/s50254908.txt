There has been interval placement of bilateral pleural pigtail catheters. Remaining support and monitoring devices are in unchanged positions including a right IJ which terminates at the distal SVC, ET tube at 4.5 cm above the carina, and a partially visualized enteric tube. Median sternotomy and valve replacements are noted. There are persistent diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally, unchanged since prior study. Bilateral pleural effusions are also unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. No pneumothorax is identified.
