Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. The lung volumes are low and bibasilar atelectasis is noted. There is mild perihilar congestion and mild pulmonary edema. A retrocardiac density containing an air-fluid level is most compatible with a hiatal hernia. No pneumothorax. No acute bony abnormalities. The heart size is difficult to assess but appears grossly within normal limits.
