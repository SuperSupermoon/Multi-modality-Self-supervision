Lung volumes remain slightly low. Streaky opacities at the left base and at the medial right base likely reflect atelectasis, although an early infectious process cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Slight interval improvement in the area of focal tracheal narrowing. No large effusions.
