Since the previous radiograph from a few hr earlier, a right pleural catheter has slightly changed in position, and note is made of substantial decrease in size of a previously noted right basilar hydro pneumothorax and accompanying re-expansion of the adjacent right lower lobe. Prominent lucency in the right mid lung region likely represents residual loculated pneumothorax in this area. Exam is otherwise similar to the recent radiograph except for worsening left retrocardiac opacification.
