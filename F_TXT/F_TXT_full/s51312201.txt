Monitoring equipment projects over the right apex, limiting assessment. A tracheostomy is in-situ, unchanged in position compared to the prior study. The patient is somewhat rotated on the current study displacing the trachea to the right. Lung volumes are unchanged with mild hyperinflation on the left. Two right-sided chest drains are unchanged in position. No definite pneumothorax seen but the right apex is not well evaluated. There has been a decrease in the small right pleural effusion. Airspace opacity at the right lung base likely related to atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded however this appearance is improving compared earlier studies.
