The cardiac silhouette size is mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications. Moderate pulmonary edema is new in the interval with a small left pleural effusion noted. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view and therefore a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Severe degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are noted.
