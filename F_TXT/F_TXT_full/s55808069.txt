1. Interval extubation. Left subclavian PICC line has its tip near the cavoatrial junction. Feeding tube remains in place with the tip within the stomach. 2. Stable bilateral diffuse airspace process which makes it challenging to detect any subtle interval changes. Relatively lower lung volumes when compared to several multiple previous prior studies. Diffuse airspace process is probably not significantly changed given the interval reduction in lung volumes. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
