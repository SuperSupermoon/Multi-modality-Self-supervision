Indwelling support and monitoring devices are remarkable for a recently placed endotracheal tube terminating 4.1 cm above the carina, and interval coiling of a feeding tube within the fundus of the stomach, as well as placement of a nasogastric tube within the stomach, which appears moderately dilated. Within the chest, cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for lower lung volumes. Patchy opacities are present in both lung bases, predominantly in the retrocardiac region, and could be due to patchy atelectasis or clinically suspected aspiration. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
