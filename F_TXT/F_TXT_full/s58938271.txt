Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening pulmonary edema. Rapidly developing areas of consolidation in the left perihilar and right basilar region, probably represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema but developing infection is also an important consideration for the right lower lobe opacity. With this in mind, short-term followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful. Left lower lobe atelectasis is new. Small bilateral pleural effusions have slightly increased.
