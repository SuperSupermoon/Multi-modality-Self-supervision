In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of a right pigtail catheter with re-expansion of the lung and almost complete resolution of the pneumothorax. However, there has been the development of much more extensive subcutaneous gas along the right lateral chest wall extending into the neck. No evidence of pneumonia.
