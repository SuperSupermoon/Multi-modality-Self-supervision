Portable semi-upright view of the chest was provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located 4.6 cm above the carina. The lungs are clear bilaterally. No effusion or pneumothorax is seen, though the right CP angle is partially excluded. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. No acute bony abnormalities are seen. However, a defect within the right humeral head is compatible with a reverse Hill-___ deformity likely reflecting chronic posterior shoulder dislocations.
