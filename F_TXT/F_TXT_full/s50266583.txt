Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a nasogastric tube which is seen projecting below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. The remainder of the examination is unchanged compared to the prior radiograph. Bilateral alveolar densities are again seen and similar in appearance. A right-sided pacemaker is unchanged with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. The monitoring and support devices are also unchanged.
