Of note, the left costophrenic angle is not imaged on this study. A Dobbhoff tube terminates within the proximal stomach. A metallic pin projects over the left upper quadrant/left hemidiaphragm. The cardiac silhouette is stable. The aorta is tortuous as before. Multi focal pulmonary opacities with coarse reticular basilar lung opacities are again demonstrated and not significantly changed from the prior exam done on ___.
