1. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged. Main pulmonary artery again is enlarged consistent with known underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is persistent stable mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and more focal airspace consolidation is seen at the left base which may represent compressive atelectasis in the setting of layering effusion, although pneumonia should also be considered. Patchy opacity at the right medial lung base likely reflects atelectasis and is unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, when compared to the most recent prior study of ___, there is increasing consolidation at the left base, but there is otherwise no significant interval change.
