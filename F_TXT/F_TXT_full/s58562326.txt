Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with a persistent moderate-sized partially loculated right pneumothorax, which remains most marked at the right base. Multi-cavitary consolidation within the right upper lobe and multiple poorly defined bilateral nodular opacities and foci of consolidation appear largely unchanged over the short interval between the two studies. Small left pleural effusion is also similar.
