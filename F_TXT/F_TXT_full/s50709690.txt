Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7 cm from the carina. Enteric tube is distally coiled within the stomach which demonstrates moderate gaseous distension. Heart size is normal. Widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to a combination of low lung volumes and AP technique with a tortuous aorta also noted. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures as a result of low lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormality is clearly seen.
