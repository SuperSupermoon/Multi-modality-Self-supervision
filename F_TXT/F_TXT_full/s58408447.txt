AP chest compared to ___: Generalized opacification in the right hemithorax is due largely to increase in a large right pleural effusion projected over at least moderately severe pulmonary edema, seen better in the left lung. Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. A feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. PIC line appears to extend approximately 2 cm into the left brachiocephalic vein ending near the midline. No pneumothorax. Feeding tube can be traced to the low esophagus, and since I cannot see the weighted tip, probably into the stomach. No pneumothorax.
