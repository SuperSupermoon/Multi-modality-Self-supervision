In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm most consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Mild effusion and atelectatic changes are probably present on the right as well. The perihilar opacifications are less prominent, most likely reflecting improvement in pulmonary vascular status, though clearing of aspiration would be another possibility.
