As compared to the prior CXR of ___, there has been slight interval improvement in appearance of interstitial opacities, which likely reflects both better ventilation and improving interstitial edema. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Left pleural effusion seen on the prior radiograph appears to have resolved.

However, the right atrial lead is currently in the right atrial appendage, previously in the right atrium proper ___ ___. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
