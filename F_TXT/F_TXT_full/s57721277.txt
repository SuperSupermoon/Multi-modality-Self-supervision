1. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle, ? small effusion. Much of this may relate to an elevated left hemidiaphragm and associated atelectasis. If there is ongoing clinical concern for possible pneumonia, then a lateral view may help to better assess the left lower lobe. No other focus suggestive of a pulmonary infiltrate is identified. 2. No pneumothorax detected. 3. Bilateral rib fractures, though difficult to assess which of these may be acute. 4. Sclerotic or calcified lesion in the right proximal humerus, not fully characterized. However, this most likely represents a calcified enchondroma. Wet reading to this effect was discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone at approximately 11:44 a.m. on the day of the exam.
