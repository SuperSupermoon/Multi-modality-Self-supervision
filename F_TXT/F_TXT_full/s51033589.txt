The tracheostomy appears in standard position. There is a left-sided chest tube which abuts the mediastinum. Again noted is the feeding tube looped in the hypopharynx, yet extending down below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of the film. The right subclavian catheter ends in the low SVC. Again seen is bilateral perihilar opacification which could be secondary to atelectasis or pneumonia, unchanged compared to the prior exam. No new focal consolidations are seen. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions. The heart size is normal.
