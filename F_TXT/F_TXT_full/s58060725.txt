A pigtail pleural catheter projects over the left lower chest, as before. Left IJ central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC. The nasogastric tube is barely visible, but the tip appears to project over the gastroesophageal junction similar to the prior examination. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Extensive heterogeneous bilateral airspace opacities have not significantly changed compared to prior examination. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
