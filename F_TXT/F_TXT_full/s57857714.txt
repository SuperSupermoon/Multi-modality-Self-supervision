As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. With respect to the right lower lobe opacity, limited to the right middle lobe. The opacity is likely caused by a combination of right pleural effusion and mild atelectasis. Left retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged. Minimal left pleural effusion is present. No fluid overload. The left pectoral pacemaker and its leads are in constant position.
