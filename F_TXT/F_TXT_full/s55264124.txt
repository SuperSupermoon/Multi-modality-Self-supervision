There has been interval removal of the temperature probe. The endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina. The enteric catheter courses below the left hemidiaphragm and out of view. The right internal jugular ECMO catheter terminates in the right atrium. There is increased opacification of the left upper lobe with air bronchograms and without evidence of associated volume loss. Finding may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema; however, there is a concern for developing infectious process. There is a stable right lower lobe opacification, which likely reflects atelectasis and small pleural effusion . Possibly trace effusion on the left.
