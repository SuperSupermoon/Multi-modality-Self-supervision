1. Interval placement of a right pigtail catheter at the lung base with decrease in overall size of pleural effusion. There is slight improving aeration at the right lung base, although there is persistent patchy opacity likely representing compressive atelectasis. The left lung remains clear. Aorta is somewhat prominent and unfolded. Overall cardiac size is stable. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
