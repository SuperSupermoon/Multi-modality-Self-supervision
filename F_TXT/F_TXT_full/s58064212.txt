Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The study was made available for my interpretation, today, ___, at 11:25 a.m. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates approximately 5.3 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube has also been placed in the interval, with side port at the level of the GE junction, but with distal tip not included in the image and likely coursing through the proximal stomach. No pneumothorax is seen. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
