A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right pulmonary artery and is in adequate position. The heart is substantially enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is a left basal opacity, minimally increased from prior study which likely represents atelectasis. There is no evidence of hemothorax or mediastinal widening. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
