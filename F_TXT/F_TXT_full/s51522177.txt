Endotracheal tube terminates 5.7 cm above the carina. There are bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, which is suspicious for infection or aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is also noted. No sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Right hilar prominence may be due to underlying lymphadenopathy. Heart size is normal.
