Mild pulmonary edema is new. However a more focal region of consolidation in the right upper lung will need to be watched closely to exclude concurrent pneumonia. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Borderline cardiomegaly and mediastinal venous engorgement are unchanged. Right PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
