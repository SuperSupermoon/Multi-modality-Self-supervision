Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Underlying trauma board and other external artifact partially obscure the view. An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.8 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm and terminating in the expected location of the stomach. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is seen.
