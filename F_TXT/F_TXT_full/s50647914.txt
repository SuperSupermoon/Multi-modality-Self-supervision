Left pleural effusion is still large, responsible for rightward mediastinal shift and left lower lobe collapse. Apparent widening of the left upper mediastinum could be due to adjacent pleural effusion. It would raise concern for bleeding only if the patient had an attempted central line placement on that side. Therefore clinical correlation is essential. Heart is mildly enlarged. On the right pulmonary vascular congestion and small right pleural effusion have worsened slightly. Mediastinal veins are greatly distended, due to volume overload or redirected portal venous flow. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement.
