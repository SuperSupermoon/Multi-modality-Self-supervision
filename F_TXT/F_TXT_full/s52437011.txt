Lung volumes are low. A right basilar pigtail catheter remains in place. A small right loculated pleural effusion with associated right basilar atelectasis is unchanged. Left basilar retrocardiac opacification is unchanged, and is most likely due to atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is also unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
