As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change in appearance of the mediastinum. No leftward or rightward mediastinum widening or blunting of mediastinal contours is visible. There is no evidence of apical cap or other pathological fluid collections. Contour of the aortic knob and the descending aorta are unremarkable. In unchanged manner, there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with atelectatic changes at the right lung bases. The alignment of the sternal wires is constant in appearance. However, if aortic pathology is suspected based on the clinical situation, CTA of the chest should be performed, given the higher sensitivity to detect subtle or subacute changes.
