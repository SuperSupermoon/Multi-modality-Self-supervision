Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion. Apparent area of homogeneous opacity has developed at the right lung base, partially obscuring the right hemidiaphragm. This could represent a right pleural effusion with or without adjacent atelectasis or consolidation. When the patient's condition permits, standard PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful to more fully evaluate this region.
