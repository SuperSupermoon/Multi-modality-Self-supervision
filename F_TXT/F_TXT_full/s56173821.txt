Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina above the level of clavical. Consider advancing ETT by 2 cms for better seating. Right PICC and subclavian line terminates at lower SVC. Swan-Ganz catheter through the left internal jugular approach ends approximately at the level of main pulmonary artery and is appropriate. Orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach and is off radiographic view. Mild pulmonary edema has improved. Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion has increased. Increased retrocardiac density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm suggesting lower lung atelectasis has also worsened since ___. Abdominal drains one in the right hypochondriac and another in the epigastric regions are unchanged in position.
