In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, bilateral lung volumes are substantially lower with substantial right middle and lower lobe atelectasis and rightward mediastinal shift. Opacities at the left lung base appear unchanged and may be consistent with atelectasis or pneumonia. There probably small, right greater than left pleural effusions. Heart size is mildly enlarged with new, mild pulmonary edema. Support devices and lines are unchanged and appropriately positioned.
