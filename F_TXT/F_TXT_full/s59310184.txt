An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. The lungs are relatively hyperinflated. There are mild bibasilar opacities which may be due to atelectasis although underlying aspiration or infection is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude on the left. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is seen.
