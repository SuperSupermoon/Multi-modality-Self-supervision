In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged, there are low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the enlarged heart. No definite vascular congestion. Continued retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable small pleural effusion. The right lung appears essentially clear.
