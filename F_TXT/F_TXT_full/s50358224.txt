In comparison with study of ___, there have apparently been several attempts at central line placement. No evidence of pneumothorax. The left IJ catheter seen previously has been removed. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. Increased opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural fluid. Little change in the moderate pulmonary edema.
