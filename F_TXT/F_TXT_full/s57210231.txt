The most left lateral aspect of the chest is excluded. The patient is intubated, the endotracheal tube terminating in the mid trachea. The lung volumes are low. It is difficult to evaluate cardiac or mediastinal structures on this limited view; an overlying trauma board including a vertical rod, obscures these structures. Patchy retrocardiac and right upper lobe opacities can be discerned, however. There is no clear evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
