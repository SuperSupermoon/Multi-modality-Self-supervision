CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___, right IJ central line is in place. The tip overlies the SVC/RA junction. There is trace lucency at the right lung apex, though not definitely different from ___. I doubt but cannot entirely exclude a tiny right pneumothorax. Right apical surgical clips again noted, though obscured by the line on this film. There is patchy opacity at the left lung base similar to prior, consistent with a pneumonic infiltrate or aspiration. No CHF or gross effusion. Right upper quadrant surgical clips noted.
