No prior studies are available for comparison. There is mild cardiomegaly, likely accentuated by the AP projection and low lung volumes. Opacification in the medial right lower lobe is of unclear etiology, but may be due to a prominent epicardial fat pad, cardiac enlargement, a pericardial cyst, or hernia. No large focal consolidation. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Incidental note is made of old fractures of the posterior left fourth and fifth ribs, with bony callus.
