Recently described asymmetrical pulmonary edema has slightly improved, particularly in the right perihilar and basilar regions. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Persistent dense left retrocardiac opacity, likely due to a combination of left lower lobe atelectasis and adjacent pleural effusion. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has decreased since the prior study. Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the supraclavicular regions bilaterally.
