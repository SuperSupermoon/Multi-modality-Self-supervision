Evaluation is limited by positioning and low lung volumes. Dense opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis though an underlying aspiration or pneumonia are additional possibilities. Relatively hazy opacification of the left hemithorax as compared to the right could represent asymmetric edema, pneumonia, aspiration of layering pleural effusion in part. The patient is intubated with endotracheal tube low lying approximately 2 cm above the carina. Review of subsequent radiograph demonstrates endotracheal tube tip in appropriate position. A central venous catheter terminates in the uppermost part of the right atrium. The heart size is not well evaluated due to positioning; however, there may be mild cardiomegaly. There are calcifications of the aortic arch. Soft tissue anchors are noted in the right shoulder.
