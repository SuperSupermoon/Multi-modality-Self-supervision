1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 5.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Left internal jugular central line with its tip in the proximal superior vena cava. 2. Persistent low lung volumes, although improving mild pulmonary edema. A few residual patchy linear opacity is seen in both bases which may reflect residual edema versus scattered subsegmental atelectasis. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
