Following insertion of a right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter, right pleural effusion has almost entirely resolved, but there is a moderate right pneumothorax, in the right lower hemithorax suggesting pleural adhesions superiorly. Poor inflation of the right lung base is due to localized visceral pleural thickening and/or adhesive atelectasis. Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. Mild interstitial edema is probably present, as well as a very small left pleural effusion. The upper esophagus is distended with air, not necessarily pathologic. Left subclavian pacer lead tip projects over the cardiac apex, presumably running along the floor of the right ventricle. No left pneumothorax.
