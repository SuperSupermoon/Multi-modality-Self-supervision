Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly is stable. Left lung consolidation has increased consistent with worsening pneumonia. Right lower lobe opacities have also increased likely increasing atelectasis, but a focus of infection can be present. ET tube is in standard position. Enteric tube tip is in the stomach. There is no evident pneumothorax. Spinal hardware is partially imaged.
