Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained. Lung volumes are low, which leads to bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the cardiac silhouette. No focal opacity is identified. There is blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle, possibly due to a small pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The right humerus is partially visualized but there is likely a chronic deformity of the humeral neck.
