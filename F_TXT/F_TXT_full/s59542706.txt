A portable erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right chest port terminating at the cavoatrial junction and multiple sternal wires. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is top-normal in size. Opacity at the right lung base likely represents a combination of right pleural fluid and atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation is identified. There is no pneumothorax. Displaced fractures of right lateral ribs are incompletely characterized regarding chronicity, potentially acute.
