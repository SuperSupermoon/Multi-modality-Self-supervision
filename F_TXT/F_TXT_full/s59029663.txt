The lungs are well inflated and clear. Mild vasculature engorgement is not very different than before, and apparent mild cardiomegaly could be due to differences in projection. Nevertheless cardiac evaluation would be reasonable; these findings neither suggest nor exclude pulmonary embolism. Bulges in the contours of descending thoracic aorta and azygos vein are due to dilated veins in patient with the anatomic variant hepatic interruption of the IVC. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
