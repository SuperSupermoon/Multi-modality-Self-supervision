Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating approximately 1.3 cm from the carina. Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Moderate cardiomegaly is present. The aorta is tortuous. Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes and supine technique. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, however subtle lucency within the left lung base could suggest a small left pneumothorax. No displaced fractures are seen.
