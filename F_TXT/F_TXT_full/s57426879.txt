An AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. On the previous examination, the patient had a pigtail drainage catheter placed anteriorly to the chest wall in an apparent presternal soft tissue cavity in this patient with a history of sternal dehiscence. The pigtail catheter has been removed. On the present frontal single view examination, one can identify a thin-wall line apparently entering the right lower anterior chest wall reaching the superior portion of the thorax where it terminates overlying the infraclavicular junction. On this single chest view, no pneumothorax can be identified and no new pulmonary abnormalities are seen. Unfortunately, the examination did not include a lateral view at this time, which is the essential component to evaluate the presternal anatomy in the patient's anterior chest wall. The chest CT examination ___ ___ is reviewed from this study is apparent that the anterior chest wall cavity is filled with large amount of fluid, which communicates through the dehisced sternum into the mediastinal structures. Additional lateral view is mandatory for evaluation of this unusual finding. Potential drainage could be monitored under fluoroscopic control.
