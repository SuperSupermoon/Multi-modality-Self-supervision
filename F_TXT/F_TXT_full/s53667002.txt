Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest. There are low lung volumes. Moderate right and small left bilateral pleural effusions persist, although right pleural effusion appears decreased in extent.. There is also likely a component of bibasilar atelectasis. Underlying infection in these locations cannot be ruled out. The remainder of the lungs bilaterally is clear. There is no pneumothorax. A right PICC terminates in the mid SVC. The cardiac size is unchanged.
