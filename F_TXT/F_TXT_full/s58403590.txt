Comparison is made with prior study ___. New opacity projecting in the right lower hemithorax is a combination of a neoesophagus and adjacent atelectasis. There is mild pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. If any, there is a small bilateral pleural effusion. Cardiac size is top normal accentuated by the low lung volumes. Nasogastric tube projects over the right chest likely in the neoesophagus, the tip is at the level of the hemidiaphragm. Right-sided chest tubes are in appropriate position. Right Port-A-Cath tip is in the upper SVC.
