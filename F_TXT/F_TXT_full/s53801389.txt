Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the right atrium. NG tube tip is in the stomach. The side port is at the EG junction and should be advanced for more standard position. Severe pulmonary edema has increased. Increased focal opacity in the left lower lobe could be part of the pulmonary edema or pneumonia. There is no evident pneumothorax or increase in pleural effusions.
