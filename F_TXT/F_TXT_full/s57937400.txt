Patchy opacities are again visualized throughout bilateral lungs with relative sparing of the left upper lobe and appear minimally improved in comparison to the prior study. More focal opacity at the right upper lobe also appears minimally improved in comparison to the prior study. A left-sided Port-A-Cath is again noted with the tip in the lower SVC. Cardiac silhouette appears stable.
