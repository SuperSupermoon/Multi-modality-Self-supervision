In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size. The configuration of the mediastinal contour is again consistent with known radiation fibrosis with associated bronchiectasis of the upper lobes. There is interval increase in the indistinctness and engorgement of pulmonary vessels, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of volume overload. Blunting of the costophrenic angles with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with layering effusions and atelectatic changes at the bases.
