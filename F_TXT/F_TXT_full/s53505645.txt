Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating 1 cm above the level of the carina. Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2.5-3 cm for more optimal positioning. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. There is left base retrocardiac opacity and subtle increased opacity projecting over the left lung which may be due to layering pleural effusion. Left base atelectasis or consolidation is not excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aorta is calcified. The bones are osteopenic. Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulder joints, partially imaged. There appears to be external artifact that overlies the right hemithorax. A left-sided PICC terminates high in position, in the region of the left subclavian vein.
