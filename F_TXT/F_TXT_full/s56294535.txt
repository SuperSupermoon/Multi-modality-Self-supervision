AP chest compared to ___. Right hemithorax is uniformly opacified and mediastinum shifted substantially to the left by a large acute or subacute right pleural effusion. Lung metastases in the aerated left lung have grown. Heart size is indeterminate, because the right heart border is obscured by pleural fluid and atelectasis. Tiny left pleural effusion is probably not clinically significant. Dr. ___ was paged at 1:10 p.m. as soon as the findings were recognized, and we discussed the findings by telephone a minute later.
