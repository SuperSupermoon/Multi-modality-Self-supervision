Supine portable AP view of the chest is obtained. The evaluation is limited as the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax is excluded. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 3.6 cm above the carina. There has also been placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip in the right upper quadrant. Otherwise, there has been no change with small bibasilar atelectasis and relative mediastinal prominence, which likely reflect portable AP technique.
