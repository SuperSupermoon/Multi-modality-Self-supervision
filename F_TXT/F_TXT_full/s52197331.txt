Comparison is somewhat difficult due to differences in technique. There is interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions. The left pleural effusion is moderate to large in size. The left heart border is largely obliterated. There is evidence of underlying atelectasis or consolidation. This is probably greater on the left but obscured by pleural fluid. Mediastinal structures appear stable. The bony thorax is grossly intact.
