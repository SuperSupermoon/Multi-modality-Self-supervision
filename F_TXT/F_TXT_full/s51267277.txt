Frontal view of the chest was obtained. Right IJ catheter terminates in the low SVC. NG tube appears to terminate below the diaphragm. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Heterogeneous bilateral widespread opacities are similar to the prior exam, taking into account the patient position, and compatible with mild pulmonary edema with superimposed multifocal pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
