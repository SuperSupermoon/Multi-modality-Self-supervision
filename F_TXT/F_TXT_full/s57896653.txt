The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately 2.2 cm from the carina. A left internal jugular central venous catheter is present with the tip in the upper SVC. A right hemodialysis catheter is unchanged with the tip at or just beyond the cavoatrial junction. An enteric tube is present coursing below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. Since prior exam, the lung volumes have improved, likely due to mechanical ventilation. There is a persistent dense opacity in the right base consistent with pneumonia. Mild pulmonary edema is not significantly changed. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
