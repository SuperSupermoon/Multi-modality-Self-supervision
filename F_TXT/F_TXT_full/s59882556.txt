Assessment is limited due to poor positioning as well as the patient's body habitus. Allowing for these limitations: Compared with the previous exam there has been interval improvement of prior interstitial pulmonary edema as well as aeration of the left lower lobe. There is persistent prominence of the left hilum, likely a combination of a very tortuous aorta with an enlarged pulmonary artery, better demonstrated on prior CT. A small left-sided pleural effusion may be present although difficult to assess. There is no right-sided effusion. Significant rightward deviation of the trachea is also stable. A right femoral pacemaker is redemonstrated with leads in stable position. Assessment of cardiac size is limited although appears stable. Rotolevoscoliosis centered in the lower thoracic spine is also stable.
