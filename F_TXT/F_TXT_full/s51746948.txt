AP chest compared to 7:21 a.m.: New nasogastric tube ends in upper portion of a non-distended stomach. Large and small bowel are distended in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, probably not appreciably changed since earlier in the day. Diaphragm elevation contributes to exceedingly low lung volumes. Widening of the upper mediastinum could be due to supine positioning, despite marking to the contrary. Pulmonary vascular engorgement and bibasilar atelectasis persist, but there is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Heart size is indeterminate, obscured by the hemidiaphragms.
