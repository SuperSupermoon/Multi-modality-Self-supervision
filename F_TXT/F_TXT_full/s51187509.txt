The endotracheal tube tip sits between the clavicular heads. An endogastric tube courses inferiorly, out of field of view. The right-sided PICC tip sits at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiomediastinal contours are exaggerated by position and technique, although their apparent growth by about 1 cm over multiple prior exams is noted; an additional contour projecting over the aortic arch represent a contained dissection/pseudoaneurysm and lymphadenopathy as seen on prior CT. There continues to be a moderate left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema lingers. There is no pneumothorax.
