In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the endotracheal tube and other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Again there is severe diffuse infiltrate of pulmonary disease bilaterally, more prominent on the right. The cavitary lesion in the left upper zone is not as well appreciated, though its inferior margin is quite well seen. Specifically, no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
