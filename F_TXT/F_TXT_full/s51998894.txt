Cardiac silhouette continues to be severely enlarged with unchanged mild fluid overload. Bilateral hemidiaphragms are obscured likely representing atelectasis and pleural effusion. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. The right IJ line is in stable position in the mid to upper SVC. The left IJ line ends at the junction with the brachiocephalic vein. ET tube is in appropriate position. Gastric tube traverses past the diaphragm and coils in the stomach.
