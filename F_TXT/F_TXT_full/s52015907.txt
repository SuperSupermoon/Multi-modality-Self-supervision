An airspace opacity in the left mid lung likely reflects re-expansion of the previously demonstrated platelike atelectasis. The left-sided pleural effusion is similar in appearance when compared to the prior study, although the loculated interstitial portion is less. There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. The right lung remains clear. No pneumothorax seen. Hardware related to posterior thoracic spine stabilization and corpectomy is unchanged in appearance. Prior resection of the left eighth rib and old healed fractures of the left fifth rib are similar in appearance.
