Lung volumes remain extremely low reflected in bibasilar atelectasis, severe but slightly improved on the left, moderate and worsened on the right. Low lung volumes exaggerate progression of moderate cardiomegaly and possibly mediastinal venous engorgement, but there is accompanying mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions presumed, probably moderate on the left and unchanged. Atrioventricular pacer leads in standard positions. Right PIC line ends in the right atrium.
