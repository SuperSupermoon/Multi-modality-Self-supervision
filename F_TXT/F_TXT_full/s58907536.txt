As compared to prior radiograph of ___, asymmetrically distributed combined alveolar and interstitial opacities have worsened, particularly in the left mid lung. These findings may be due to asymmetrical edema with or without superimposed secondary process such as infectious pneumonia or aspiration. Bibasilar atelectasis has worsened on the right and improved on the left, and note is made of small bilateral pleural effusions but no visible pneumothorax.
