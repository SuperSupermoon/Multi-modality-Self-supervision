As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in severity of the pre-existing pulmonary edema. Also increased are areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. The left chest tube has been re-positioned. The mediastinal drains appear slightly shifted to the right, which is caused by patient's position. The other monitoring and support devices, including the Swan-Ganz catheter are in unchanged position. No evidence of pneumothorax. Bilateral mild pleural effusions, located along the lateral and apical parts of the pleural spaces.
