Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier. There has been interval worsening of bilateral perihilar consolidations. They are consistent with worsening pulmonary edema superimposed to likely an area of aspiration in the left. There are persistent low lung volumes. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions. Lines and tubes are in unchanged position. There are increasing bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal contours are obscured by the lung abnormalities.
