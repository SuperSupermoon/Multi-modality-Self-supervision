There are relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, no focal consolidation is seen. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image, however, and no evidence of large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
