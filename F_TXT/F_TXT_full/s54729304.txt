Left hemithorax remains nearly completely opacified with a small amount of residual aerated lung in the left juxtahilar region. There is known post-obstructive consolidation and collapse involving the majority of the left lung on prior CT of ___, as well as a coexisting pleural effusion. The right lung is hyperexpanded, but grossly clear, and endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in place.
