A confluent area of consolidation in the right juxtahilar region obscuring the right heart border has worsened since the most recent radiograph of ___ on ___, but appears similar to the earlier radiograph of that date. More extensive right lower lobe opacity on that radiograph has improved. However, left lower lobe opacity has progressively worsened, now obscuring a majority of the left hemidiaphragm contour. There is persistent widening of the vascular pedicle, accompanied by increasing pulmonary vascular engorgement, worsening perihilar haziness and bilateral septal lines. Small pleural effusions are not appreciably changed.
