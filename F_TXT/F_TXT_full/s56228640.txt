There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. There is subtle left basilar retrocardiac opacity, which most likely relates to atelectasis. If patient able, dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful further assessment. No large pleural effusion is seen, however, there is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle and trace pleural effusion may be present. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal, likely exaggerated by AP technique.
