A left PICC is unchanged in position with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. A right pleural pigtail catheter appears stable. There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax. There is persistent hazy opacification at the right mid-to-lower lung zone and silhouetting of the right costophrenic angle compatible with small layering pleural effusion, unchanged. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle, most likely represents left basilar atelectasis with possible trace pleural fluid. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
