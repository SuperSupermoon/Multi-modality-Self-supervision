As compared to the previous radiograph, multiple new ECG cables are overlaying the patient and decrease in the image quality. There is unchanged evidence of moderate pulmonary edema, associated with known multifocal pneumonia. The transparency of the right upper lobe has increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. Overall, however, lung volumes remained low. Moderate cardiomegaly, no larger pleural effusions. No new focal parenchymal opacities. Position of the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are constant.
