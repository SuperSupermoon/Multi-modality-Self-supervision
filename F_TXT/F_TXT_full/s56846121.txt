Since 1 day prior, there has been interval removal of an endotracheal tube and an enteric tube. A loculated right pleural effusion has increased in size. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Bilateral parenchymal opacities are essentially unchanged and may reflect pulmonary edema or multifocal infection. No pneumothorax. A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.
