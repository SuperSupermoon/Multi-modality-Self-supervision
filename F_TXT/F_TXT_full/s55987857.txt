The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. Streaky basilar opacities, more confluent on the left than the right, are most consistent with atelectasis, increased since the prior study, although not widespread. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus makes it difficult to exclude a trace pleural effusion, but there is no definite effusion.
