Mild to moderate pulmonary edema as seen in the left lung has not changed appreciably. Opacification of the right lung is more significant common due to pneumonia like consolidation in all lobes. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion and severe cardio mediastinal widening due to chronic pericardial effusion are long-standing. ET tube ends at the thoracic inlet, no less than 7 cm from the carina and could be advanced 2 cm for more secure seating. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery. Feeding tube ends in the distal stomach. No pneumothorax.
