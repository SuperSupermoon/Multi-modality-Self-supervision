Again seen is a right pigtail catheter overlying the right lung base. There is a large right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Allowing for differences in positioning, this is essentially unchanged compared with 1 day earlier. No pneumothorax is detected, though faint lucency overlying the right lung base could reflect the locules of air identified on the interval CT scan. Again seen is atelectasis at the left lung base. There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged seen and the remains midline. Mild right convex curvature in the upper thoracic spine is likely present.
