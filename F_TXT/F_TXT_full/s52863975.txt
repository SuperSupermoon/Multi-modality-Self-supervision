AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided. Overlying EKG leads are present. There is mediastinal widening which could reflect technique, though underlying mediastinal abnormality cannot be excluded. Irregular nodularity in the right upper lobe appears grossly stable from ___ radiograph. There is increased reticular opacity in the lower lungs bilaterally which may in part represent atelectasis, though the possibility of fibrotic changes not excluded. There is no convincing sign of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. The heart size is normal. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm. Degenerative changes are again seen at the left glenohumeral joint.
