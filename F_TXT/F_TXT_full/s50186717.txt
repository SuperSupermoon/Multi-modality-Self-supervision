Following removal of a right pleural catheter, a small right apical pneumothorax is again demonstrated, and is minimally decreased compared to the prior radiograph. Small right pleural effusion is similar, but there is improving adjacent atelectasis or consolidation in the right retrocardiac region. Enlarged cardiac silhouette is stable in appearance consistent with known pericardial effusion, and multifocal calcified pleural plaques bilaterally remain unchanged, in keeping with prior asbestos exposure.
