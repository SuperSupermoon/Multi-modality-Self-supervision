AP chest compared to ___: Diffuse interstitial abnormality is more pronounced in the left lung than the right, progressed minimally since ___, while previous interstitial abnormality at the right base has improved. I suspect it was pulmonary edema two weeks ago and now is an infection in the left lower lung. Small pleural effusion is present, if any. No pneumothorax. Heart size normal. Left hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement. There is no evidence of adenopathy elsewhere in the chest.
