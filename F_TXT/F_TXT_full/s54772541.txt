A new region of consolidation is developed at the lower pole of the right hilus. Whether this is pneumonia or atelectasis is radiographically indeterminate. Interval increase in the caliber of left upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is the only change to suggest any cardiac decompensation. There is no pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Left jugular line ends at the origin of the left brachiocephalic vein.
