A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of the left PICC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and the lungs are fairly well aerated. There is persistent opacity at the right lung base, increased compared to the prior chest radiograph, likely corresponding to the small to moderate pleural effusion seen on CT from the day prior. Superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting. There is no evidence of vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
