AP chest compared to preoperative chest radiographs, ___: Moderate subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the left lateral upper abdomen and chest wall. I do not think there is any appreciable pneumothorax. Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion. There may be a very small pneumomediastinum, generally of no clinical significance. The heart size is normal. Right lung is clear.
