Left-sided pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. An enteric tube is demonstrated with tip in the distal aspect of the stomach. Low lung volumes are re- demonstrated. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Peripheral and basilar predominant coarse heterogeneous opacities with fibrosis and associated bronchiectasis are compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Hypertrophic changes are seen within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
