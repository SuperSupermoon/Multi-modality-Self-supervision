Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy. There has been mediastinum and cardiac valve replacement. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. Evidence of old rib fractures is seen bilaterally. The previously seen small bilateral pleural effusions have likely decreased in size.
