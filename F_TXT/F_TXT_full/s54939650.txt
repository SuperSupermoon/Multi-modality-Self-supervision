Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 04:04 a.m. The current study demonstrates substantial interval improvement of pulmonary edema, currently mild to moderate with persistent small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiomegaly is unchanged as well as dilated pulmonary arteries most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension. There is no pneumothorax. The right internal jugular line tip terminates at the level of low SVC/cavoatrial junction.
