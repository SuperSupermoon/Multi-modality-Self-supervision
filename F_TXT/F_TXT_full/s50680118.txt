As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral small pleural effusions. The transparency in the right upper lobe has substantially improved, likely reflecting improvement of the pre-existing pneumonia. However, the parenchymal opacities at the left and right lung bases persist. In addition, the diameter of the vascular structures has increased, likely reflecting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumothorax.
