There is been interval placement of an ET tube which terminates in the right mainstem bronchus. This can be safely retracted approximately 3 cm for proper positioning in the distal trachea. There are again seen low lung volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. There is interval increase in opacification of the left lower lobe which is likely left lower lobe collapse secondary to right mainstem bronchus intubation. Otherwise, there is no change in the lung parenchyma in comparison to prior radiograph. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
