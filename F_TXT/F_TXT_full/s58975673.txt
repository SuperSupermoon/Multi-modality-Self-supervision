1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. The Dobbhoff feeding tube remains below the diaphragm with the tip coiled within the stomach. A round calcification in the right upper quadrant likely represents a calcified gallstone. There continues to be a diffuse bilateral airspace and interstitial abnormality with more focal changes in the right mid to upper lung where there is a suggestion of honeycombing more peripherally. These findings most likely are consistent with underlying interstitial lung disease with superimposed pulmonary edema given that the findings are fluctuating over serial radiographs. A superimposed infection would be less likely. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning between studies. No pneumothorax.
