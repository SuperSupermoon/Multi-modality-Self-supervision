The patient is status post median sternotomy. Dual-lead left-sided AICD is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. A left ventricular assist device is in place, similar in position. There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. As noted in the prior study, there is right base, possibly right middle lobe opacity which actually appears decreased as compared to the prior study but persistent and could be due to underlying consolidation from pneumonia or aspiration; there may be an associated small right pleural effusion. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. No pneumothorax is seen.
