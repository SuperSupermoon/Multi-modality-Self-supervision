Since the prior radiograph performed earlier this morning, there has been interval placement of a left-sided IJ catheter which terminates in the distal SVC. ET tube is 4.8 cm above the carina. Enteric tube extends to the stomach. Right PICC line is unchanged in position, with the tip located in the distal SVC. Lung volumes are persistently low. There are diffuse parenchymal opacities, more prominent in the bilateral perihilar regions, which suggests pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is again noted. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
