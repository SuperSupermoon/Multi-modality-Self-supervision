Opacification of the apex of the right chest is unchanged and may be likely secondary to a combination of pleural fluid and hematoma. The layering right pleural effusion is also unchanged. There appears to be slight interval worsening of the right middle lobe consolidation. A right-sided chest tube courses medially to the apex, unchanged in position compared to the prior exam. The left lung interstitial edema and small left pleural effusion are unchanged compared to the prior exam. The ET tube terminates 2.4 cm from the carina. An enteric catheter courses below the diaphragm with the tip below the field of view of the exam. Sternal wires are intact over the lower half of the sternum.
