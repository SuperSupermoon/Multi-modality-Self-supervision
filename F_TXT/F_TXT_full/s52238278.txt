There is a persistent large right pleural effusion with consolidation at the right lung base which could reflect lobar atelectasis, although pneumonia or even a mass cannot be excluded. The left lung remains clear. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Aorta is somewhat unfolded and tortuous. Overall heart size is difficult to assess given the large right pleural collection.
