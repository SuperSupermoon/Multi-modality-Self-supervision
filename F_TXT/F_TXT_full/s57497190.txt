Compared to ___ at 11:56, no gross change is detected. Again seen is left-sided catheter. There is a possible tiny knee left apical pneumothorax. Patchy opacity at the left base is again noted, possibly slightly improved. Minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle could be due to either atelectasis or small pleural fusion. Minimal patchy atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region is again noted, very slightly more pronounced. No gross right effusion. No CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Left mid clavicular fracture again noted, unchanged in alignment.
