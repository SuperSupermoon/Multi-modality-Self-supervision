ET tube has been repositioned, now less than two cm from the carina. It should be withdrawn 15 mm to ovoid unilateral intubation. Lung volumes remain quite low, but there has been an improvement in pulmonary edema. Bibasilar consolidation persists. Whether this is atelectasis or pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. Heart is top-normal size. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial. Nasogastric drainage tube ends in the mid stomach. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC. Left pic line still ends in the upper right atrium. No pneumothorax.
