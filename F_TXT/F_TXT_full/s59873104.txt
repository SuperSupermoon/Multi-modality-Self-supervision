As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions, no pneumothorax. No other relevant pulmonary changes. Slight increase in radiodensity of the upper mediastinum is likely caused by the lower inspiratory volume.
