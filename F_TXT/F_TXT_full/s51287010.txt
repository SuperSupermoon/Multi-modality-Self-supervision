Low lung volumes bilaterally. Mildly enlarged heart with interstitial and alveolar prominence, mild azygos vein prominence, peribronchial cuffing, and Kerley B lines is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion. Bilateral hilar prominance may be from pulmonary edema. Mediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable. Visualized pleural surfaces are normal. No pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
