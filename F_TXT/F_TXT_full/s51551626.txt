Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for portable supine technique and rotation related scoliosis. Cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged, and could reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. Lungs are clear except for minimal patchy and linear opacities at the bases, suggestive of atelectasis. The left retrocardiac patchy opacity could potentially also be due to aspiration or early pneumonia. Curvilinear interface in the right apex is most likely due to a skin fold, particularly as there is no evidence of a pneumothorax in this region on the CTA of the neck from a few hours earlier. If there is clinical suspicion for pneumothorax, fully upright or lateral decubitus chest radiograph would be recommended to exclude this possibility.
