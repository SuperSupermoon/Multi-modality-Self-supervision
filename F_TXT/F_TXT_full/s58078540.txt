A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, left chest tube, left subclavian line terminating in the mid SVC, and enteric tube extending below the diaphragm in terminating in the stomach, all unchanged in position. Lung volumes are lower, with bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, there appears to be increased opacity in the left base, which likely reflects atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
