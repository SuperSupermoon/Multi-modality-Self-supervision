AP chest compared to ___ and ___: On ___, patient had mild interstitial pulmonary edema that suggests that the new largely interstitial abnormality, even though it is predominantly left sided, is once again due to heart failure. On the other hand, there is very dense consolidation at the left lung base medially, and pleural effusion is predominantly left sided, not the typical pattern of pulmonary edema. Therefore, left lower lobe atelectasis or left lower lobe pneumonia is likely present. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal widening in the right lower paratracheal station is due to adenopathy, and there are multiple pulmonary nodules, all unchanged.
