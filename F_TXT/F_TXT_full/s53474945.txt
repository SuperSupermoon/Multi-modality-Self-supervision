As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated, but the right internal jugular vein catheter remains in situ. The heart continues to be at the upper range of normal. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumonia. No larger pleural effusions. Slight increase in radiodensity at the right lung bases is caused by the patient position and rotation.
