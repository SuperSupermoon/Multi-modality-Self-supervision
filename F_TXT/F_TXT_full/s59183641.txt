There is a dual lead right pectoral pacemaker with leads noted within the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. Median sternotomy wires are well aligned. Mild cardiomegaly and mild central pulmonary vascular congestion are noted. Low lung volumes results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Left lower lobe atelectasis and a probable small pleural effusion are seen, with superimposed infection difficult to exclude. The upper lung fields are grossly clear.
