Portable semi-upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. Right costophrenic angle is blunted, suggestive of small pleural effusion. There is no left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Heart is moderately enlarged. Pacemaker leads project over right atrium and right ventricle. A large destructive lesion involving the left shoulder is noted, which is slightly progressed since prior. Left scapula is not visualized. A soft tissue density projecting the anterior right fifth rib is new since prior and concerning for a new lytic metastatic lesion. Associated soft tissue mass is better seen on CTA chest of the same date. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Lung volumes are low. Prominent air-filled loop of large bowel is seen in the left upper abdomen.
