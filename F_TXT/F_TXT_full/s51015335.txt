Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a consolidation in the left lower lobe which is slightly increased compared to the recent CT. Parenchymal opacification in the right lower lobe likely reflects aspiration. Diffusely abnormal background parenchymal changes are again seen. The bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size. There is an unchanged rounded structure in the right costophrenic sinus which was masked by the pleural effusion on the prior CT exam. There is stable deformity of the left thoracic cage. No pneumothorax.
