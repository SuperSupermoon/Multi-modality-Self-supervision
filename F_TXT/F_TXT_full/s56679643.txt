Moderately severe bibasilar consolidation is improving on the right crit particularly, less dramatically on the left. Since there is no pulmonary edema in the upper lobes this is more likely to be combination of pneumonia and aspiration than chest dependent edema, even of the heart is huge and the pulmonary vasculature is engorged. Small right pleural effusion unchanged. No pneumothorax.
