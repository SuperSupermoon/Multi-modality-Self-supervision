The new endotracheal tube tip projects approximately 0.5 cm into the right mainstem bronchus and should be withdrawn for optimal placement above the carina. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. Moderate severe cardiomegaly is stable. Right lung opacities are again noted, likely atelectasis or developing infection. Bilateral pleural effusions are grossly unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax.
