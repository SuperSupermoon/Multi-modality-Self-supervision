Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip course may be intra-arterial given its position overlying the inferior aspect of the aortic knob and does not course in the expected region of the left brachiocephalic vein. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. The endotracheal tube remains low lying, terminating approximately 2.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is within the stomach. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with the heart size remaining mild to moderately enlarged. Mild upper zone vascular redistribution is likely due to supine positioning. Atelectasis is demonstrated in both lung bases. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. No displaced fractures are apparent.
