Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiac size is minimally enlarged accentuated by the low lung volumes. Widened mediastinum is unchanged. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better seen in prior CT torso. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position. Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side, and multifocal diffuse opacities, larger in the left lung, are unchanged, better evaluated in prior CT. As mentioned before, these opacities have a wide differential diagnosis, could be aspiration and/or infection, edema or hemorrhage.
