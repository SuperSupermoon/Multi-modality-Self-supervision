Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Obscuration of the hemidiaphragms is unchanged and explained by mediastinal lipomatosis shown on prior chest CT. Trace atelectasis is present at the left lung base. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.
