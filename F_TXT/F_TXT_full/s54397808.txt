AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained ___ at 11:00 p.m. (approximately two hours earlier). The patient was intubated with the ET tube tip being almost 3 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged since the patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. Left basal linear opacities are unchanged, most likely representing scarring versus atelectasis.
