Comparison is made with prior study ___ earlier in the morning. ET tube tip is only 1.7 cm above the carina, can be withdrawn couple of centimeters for a more standard position. Left PICC tip is in the upper SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach but the side port at the GE junction, should be advanced for a more standard position. There has been progressive interval worsening of right lower lobe opacity consistent with worsening atelectasis, almost collapsed right lower lobe. Left lower lobe opacities have increased. Could be due to atelectasis and/or aspiration. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are probably small. Spinal hardware is again noted. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at 10:15 a.m. at the time of the discovery of the findings.
