As compared to the previous radiograph, the course of the nasogastric tube is not substantially changed. The tip of the tube currently projects over the middle parts of the stomach. The distribution of the pre-existing right pleural effusion is slightly changed but the overall extent appears to be constant. Tracheostomy tube and right PICC line are in identical position. Moderate interstitial fluid overload and mild pulmonary edema persists. Moderate cardiomegaly.
