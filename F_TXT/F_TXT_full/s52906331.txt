the endotracheal tube ends 6.3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film, but the side port is probably above the GE junction -- clinical consideration regarding advancing the tube is therefore reuqested. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cephalization of the upper lobe lung markings bilaterally either represents mild pulmonary vascular congestion or scarring. Old healed right-sided rib fractures noted.
