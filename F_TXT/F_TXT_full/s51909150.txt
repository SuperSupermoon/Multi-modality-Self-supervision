Lung volumes remain low but slightly improved on the left with improved aeration of the left lung base. A left-sided chest tube is in-situ, unchanged in appearance. No pneumothorax seen. There is minimal airspace opacity in the left lower lobe which may reflect re-expansion pulmonary edema, there is likely a small residual pleural effusion. There is some residual left basilar atelectasis. The right lung appears grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged compared to the prior study.
