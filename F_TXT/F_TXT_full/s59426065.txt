As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. Lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressures. Mild cardiomegaly persists. A left pleural effusion restricted to the area of the left costophrenic sinus is seen in unchanged manner. At the right lung base, there is a triangular parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms, likely reflecting aspiration or pneumonia, as already suspected on the occasion of the previous radiograph. No new parenchymal opacities.
