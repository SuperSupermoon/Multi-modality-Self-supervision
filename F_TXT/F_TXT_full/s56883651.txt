As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacity with air-fluid levels, partly pleural and partly parenchymal, has increased in extent and severity. The mediastinal shift towards the right is more extensive than before, suggesting increasing volume loss on the right. On the left, the image is unchanged. No evidence of acute left lung disease.
