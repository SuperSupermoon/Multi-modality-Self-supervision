A large area of consolidation in the right lower lobe has increased in size. And appears less well-marginated as compared to the ___ radiograph. Additionally, a new crest enteric lucency is observed along the superior margin and a rounded area of lucency is apparent along the inferior aspect. Although difficult to assess on a portable chest radiograph, this may indicate areas of necrosis. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
