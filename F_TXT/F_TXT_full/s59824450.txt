1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 8 cm above the carina. Advancement by 3 cm would be recommended. Right internal jugular large-bore catheter continues to have its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Patchy opacity at the right base is again seen, likely reflecting atelectasis. Improved aeration at the left base. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles which could reflect small effusions or chronic pleural thickening. No evidence of a pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Results were communicated directly to the covering nurse, ___ ___, by phone on ___ at 11:23 a.m. at the time of discovery.
