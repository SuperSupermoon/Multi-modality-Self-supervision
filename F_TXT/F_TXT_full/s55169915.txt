The heart is enlarged. There is patchy left basilar opacity suggesting minor atelectasis superimposed on a prominent pericardial fat pad, not significantly changed, although it is difficult to exclude a superimposed process. Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. There is no definite pleural effusion, although again it is difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion on the left side. There is no pneumothorax.
