Patient has severe emphysema and tracheal configuration suggesting a propensity for tracheomalacia. The emphysema would make the distribution of pulmonary edema extremely asymmetric, and difficult to distinguish from pulmonary hemorrhage in pneumonia which are more focal. Progressive heterogeneous pulmonary consolidation following extubation may reflect the terminal lesion of positive pressure support rather than real worsening. It now involves more of the right upper lobe. Left upper lobe, the most severely affected and site of hemorrhage has not improved. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left stable since ___. The appearance of the left lower lobe is more suggestive of edema than pneumonia, although heart size is normal and mediastinal vasculature has never been engorged.
