The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is slightly tortuous and demonstrates diffuse calcifications, most marked at the aortic knob. Enlarged right paratracheal stripe may reflect tortuous vasculature, lymphadenopathy or a large right thyroid goiter. The lungs are hyperinflated. There is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no frank pulmonary edema is seen. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Thoracic scoliosis is noted.
