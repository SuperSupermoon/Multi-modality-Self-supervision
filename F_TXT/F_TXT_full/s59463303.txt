In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the two new chest tubes are in position. The right one curves downward with the tip apparently posteriorly in the costophrenic angle. The left extends to the apex and then slightly turns downward. Extensive subcutaneous gas bilaterally makes it somewhat difficult to evaluate for possible pneumothorax. Nevertheless, there does appear to be a small apical pneumothorax on the right. The previously noted fractures are greatly obscured by overlying subcutaneous gas.
