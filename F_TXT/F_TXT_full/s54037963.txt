The tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position. Right PICC ends at the low SVC. Compared to the prior study, performed 1 day prior there is increased atelectasis in the right upper lobe, new linear opacities in the mid left lung and the previously present left basilar opacities have increased. The new left lung opacities likely represent atelectasis and less likely aspiration. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is identified. The mediastinal contours are stable. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
