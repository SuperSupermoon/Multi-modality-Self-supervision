AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___ and multiple prior studies. Current study demonstrates the patchy character of the multifocal consolidations that are concerning for diffuse infectious process or potentially ARDS. There is questionable cavity in the left lower lung and potentially in the right lower lobe, thus reassessment of the patient with chest CT is required. Tubes and lines are in unchanged position as well as the contours of the left ventricle. No pneumothorax is seen.
