The endotracheal tube ends approximately 6 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube is present with both the side port and tip below the gastroesophageal junction. Otherwise the lungs are well expanded. Bilateral hilar engorgement with associated diffuse bilateral interstitial thickening, alveolar infiltrates and Kerley B lines suggest interstitial pulmonary edema. There might be a small amount of fluid tracking along the minor fissure in the right. There is left lower lobe atelectasis with an associated small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified.
