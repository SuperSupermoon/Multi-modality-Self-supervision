There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema. Increased opacification adjacent to the right hilum may represent asymmetric edema or possibly early pneumonia. The heart is stably mildly enlarged. The endotracheal tube ends 6.1 cm from the carina. The enteric tube ends within the decompressed stomach, however the side port ends in the distal esophagus, this should be advanced 7 cm for optimal placement. A right IJ introduction sheath ends at the origin of the SVC. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
