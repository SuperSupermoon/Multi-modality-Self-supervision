There is little discernible left pneumothorax, and no appreciable left pleural effusion, however there is more subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall which is sometimes in indication of increasing intra pleural pressure in the setting of pneumothorax. Therefore repeat chest radiographs would be indicated if the patient continues to manifest shortness of breath, even though there is little pneumothorax currently. . Right lung is grossly clear. Mediastinum is normal and midline. Left lung mass noted.
