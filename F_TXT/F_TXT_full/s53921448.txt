1. Interval placement of pigtail catheter which has its tip in the left costophrenic angle. There has been interval decrease in a left pleural effusion where there is now patchy airspace disease within the left mid and lower lung which could reflect residual atelectasis, re-expansion pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. Left hemidiaphragm remains elevated. No large pneumothorax is appreciated. The right lung is grossly clear. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the left airspace disease.
