The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the level of the carina. Lung volumes are extremely low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Multiple airspace opacities overlying the right mid and lower lung correlate with consolidation seen on recent CT. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac size is difficult to assess given low lung volumes and patient positioning, but appears mildly enlarged.
