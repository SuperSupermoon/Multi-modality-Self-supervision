There is a new right internal jugular central venous catheter with the tip in the mid SVC. There is no evidence of associated pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube tip remains in the mid trachea. An enteric tube is visualized with the tip in the stomach. The heart is normal in size. Atherosclerotic calcifications are again noted at the aortic arch. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is again noted, suggestive of a small effusion or perhaps chronic scarring. Moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted without any focal consolidation. Increased opacifcation at the right bse medially. This raises the possibility of a developing pneuimonia
