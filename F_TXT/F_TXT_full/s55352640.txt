Single portable chest radiograph is provided. This study is limited but demonstrates no large confluent consolidation, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate due to poor inspiratory effort. An IVC filter is in place. The patient has had multiple vertebroplasties. Bony structures are otherwise intact.
