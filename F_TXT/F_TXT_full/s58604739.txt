There is a new large right pneumothorax which was not present on the prior examination. There is no mediastinal shift or flattening of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm to suggest tension. The right lower lobe opacity present on the prior study is now more apparent likely due to compressive atelectasis from the pneumothorax. Left lung is clear. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in appropriate and unchanged position.
