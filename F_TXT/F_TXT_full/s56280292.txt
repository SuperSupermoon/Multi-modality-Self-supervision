Persistent right base opacity representing right lower lobe mass with postobstructive right lower lobe collapse, is again seen, with possible slight decrease in adjacent right base. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. Small right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude, no large pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax sene.
