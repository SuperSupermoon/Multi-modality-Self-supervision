There has been significant interval increase in the right apical pneumothorax, now moderate to large. There is associated increased density in the right lung, likely attributable to progressive collapse. There is no definite air-fluid level. The right chest tube is in grossly unchanged position, deviated medially slightly by the collapsed lung. A trace left pleural effusion is unchanged, the left lung is otherwise clear. Allowing for rotation there is likely minimal rightward mediastinal shift. Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged. A Dobhoff tube terminates within the stomach.
