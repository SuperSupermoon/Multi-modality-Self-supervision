Marked right pleural calcifications encasing most of the lung limiting evaluation. However, overall appearance has not changed. The previously noted interstitial edema has improved. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may reflect a small effusion. Several calcified nodular opacities in the left lower lung and at both apices are suggestive of prior granulomatous infection. No definite new airspace consolidation is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient rotation. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Endotracheal tube and right central line are unchanged in position.
