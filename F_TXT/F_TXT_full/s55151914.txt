The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Linear bibasilar opacities most compatible with atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. The central pulmonary vessels are engorged, and hazy peripheral interstitial opacities likely reflect trace edema. There are trace bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax or focal consolidation is seen.
