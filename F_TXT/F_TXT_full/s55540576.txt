Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new parenchymal opacification in the right upper lobe, which could represent an infectious process. The previously demonstrated bilateral lower lung opacities are unchanged since the prior study. The left PICC line now lies in the upper SVC, changed from prior radiograph when it was located in the lower SVC. A Dobbhoff tube is seen in standard position in the stomach. Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis of the left lung base are also unchanged.
