The right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. The lung volumes are low. The heart size remains moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. Widening of the mediastinum is likely related to supine positioning and elevated venous pressures which is mild. There is no focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or large pneumothorax on this supine study. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
