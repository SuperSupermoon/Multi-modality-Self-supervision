Tip of the endotracheal tube is less than 2 cm above the carina and should be withdrawn 2 cm for optimal placement. Transesophageal drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced 10 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction. Increasing opacification in the left lower lobe is presumably new atelectasis. Right lung is clear. Scoliosis is very severe. No pneumothorax.
