AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes have improved, but less atelectasis at the base of the left lung, and persistence of moderate to severe atelectasis on the right. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable, basal pleural tubes still in place. Normal postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette, midline drains in place, is maintained. Right internal jugular sheath ends at the thoracic inlet. No pneumothorax. The thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous, unchanged since the pre-operative study.
