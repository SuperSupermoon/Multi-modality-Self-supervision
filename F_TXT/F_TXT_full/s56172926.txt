As compared to ___ chest radiograph, heterogeneous and asymmetrically distributed opacities have substantially improved, with residual opacities predominantly in the right lung. These findings may be due to resolving pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, and are superimposed upon underlying emphysema. Small left pleural effusion is evident but there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
