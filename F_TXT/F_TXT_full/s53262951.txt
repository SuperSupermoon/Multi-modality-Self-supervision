In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes. Monitoring and support devices remain in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Opacification at the left base is consistent with some volume loss in the lower lobes, possibly with small pleural effusion. The right lung is clear except for apparent atelectatic streaks.
