Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 10:18 p.m. The ET tube tip is 3.8 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach, although too proximal and might be further advanced. Lungs are essentially clear. Prominence of the aortic knob might be consistent with aneurysmatic dilatation and might be further assessed with chest CT if clinically warranted.
