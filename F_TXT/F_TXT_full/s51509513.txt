The endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm from the carina. The enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view within the stomach. Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and subsegmental atelectasis bilaterally. Retrocardiac and medial right lung base opacities likely represent atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
