As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The right chest tube remains in situ. The patient has received a tracheostomy tube. The tip of the tracheostomy tube is in expected position. Overall, the lung volumes have decreased, leading to increase of the pre-existing areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung base. Also, there is unchanged blunting of the left costodiaphragmatic recess, suggesting the presence of a small left pleural effusion. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with minimal fluid overload. No evidence of pneumothorax.
