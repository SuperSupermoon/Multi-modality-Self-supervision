Lung volumes are low. Heart size is accentuated as a result, appearing mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky and patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
