AP portable semi upright view of the chest. A new central venous catheter is seen projecting over the left neck extending inferiorly to the level of the aortic knob. Given the vertical orientation of the catheter and findings seen on prior CT chest, the catheter likely resides within a small pericardial vena or branch of the left superior intercostal vein. Removal is recommended. Subtle opacities in the lower lungs likely represent atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. No large effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable. Bony structures are intact.
