Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, there appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Linear left base opacity most likely represents atelectasis, however, infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
