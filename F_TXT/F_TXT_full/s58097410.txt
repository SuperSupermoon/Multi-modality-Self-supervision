As compared to the previous radiograph, the opacity at the right lung base and in the right mid lung has continued to progress. Air bronchograms are seen. The left lung is unchanged but the heart remains enlarged. Overall, the findings are highly suggestive of aspiration pneumonia, with underlying mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
