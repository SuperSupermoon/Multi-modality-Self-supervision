In comparison with the preoperative study of ___, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip about 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the level of the esophagogastric junction. It should be pushed forward at least 10 cm so that the side port would be within the stomach. There are lower lung volumes with poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with small pleural effusion and atelectatic changes in the left lower lobe. No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
