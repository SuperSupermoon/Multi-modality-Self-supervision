AP chest compared to ___: There is new veil-like opacification in the lower two-thirds of the left hemithorax. I cannot tell if this is pleural effusion, or less likely perihilar pulmonary edema. On the right, the loculated right pleural effusion has changed in distribution but not in overall size, still moderate. Aeration of the right lung base is poor, probably atelectasis. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
