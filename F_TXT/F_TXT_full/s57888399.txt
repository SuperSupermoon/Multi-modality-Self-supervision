Portable supine chest radiograph shows no change in positioning of a large bore right IJ central venous catheter. Since yesterday, the patient has been endotracheally intubated and the tip of the endotracheal tube is 4 cm above the carina and the cuff appears maximally inflated. Dense obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and perihilar region persists with suggestion of the right hilar or perihilar mass, unchanged from previous studies. The heart appears enlarged. The left hemidiaphragm is also obscured and speckled density of the spleen is visible. Bones are diffusely sclerotic.
