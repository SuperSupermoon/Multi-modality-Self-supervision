Lungs are well expanded and nearly clear. Previous heterogeneous consolidation at the right lung base has cleared substantially. If this was aspiration it has probably not progressed in pneumonia. Heart size is normal. Widening of the upper mediastinum is chronic, probably due to combination of fat deposition and large mediastinal vessels. There is no pleural abnormality. Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
