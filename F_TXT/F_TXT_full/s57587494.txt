Lung volumes have improved when compared to the prior study. There is unfolding of the right pigtail catheter where it enters the pleural space. There is improved aeration of the right lung however there is residual airspace opacity possibly reflecting re-expansion pulmonary edema. Scattered air bronchograms are noted. The left lung is relatively clear with patchy areas of airspace opacity in the left base. The left-sided pigtail catheter is similar in appearance when compared to the prior study. A tunneled right intern middle jugular catheter terminates near the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax seen.
