Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube is in the standard position. Dobbhoff tube tip is at the level of the hemidiaphragm should be advanced for more standard position. Second NG tube tip is in the stomach in appropriate position. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased. Right upper lobe atelectasis has markedly improved. Right perihilar, right lower lobe opacities are likely due to aspiration. Left lower lobe atelectasis is new. There is no pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
