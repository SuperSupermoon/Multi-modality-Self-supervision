Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The heart size is enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal contours are grossly unchanged. Mild interstitial opacities are seen, minimally more pronounced than on the prior study and might be consistent with vascular engorgement. Given the___ medical history, the engorgement might represent a volume overload, although other etiologies cannot be excluded.
