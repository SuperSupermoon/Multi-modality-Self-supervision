Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. There has been interval increase in opacification in bilateral lung fields, right greater than left, consistent pulmonary edema. Superimposed infection could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is a new small right-sided pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube ends 1 cm from the carina and the endotracheal cuff appears hyperinflated.
