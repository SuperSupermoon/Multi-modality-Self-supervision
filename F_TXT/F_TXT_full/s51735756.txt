AP chest compared to ___: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new, but there is no pulmonary edema. Right lung is grossly clear. Heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung could be early pneumonia, but is also readily explained by mild atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion. Conventional radiographs recommended when feasible for a more complete evaluation. Mild cardiomegaly stable. No pneumothorax.
