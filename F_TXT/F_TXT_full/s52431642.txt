Comparison is made with prior study ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There are persistent low lung volumes. There are increasing atelectases in the right base. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacities are unchanged. This could be due to a combination of small effusion and adjacent consolidation. The consolidation could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia. Mild-to-moderate vascular congestion is stable. There is less engorgement of the vessels in the mediastinum. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position.
