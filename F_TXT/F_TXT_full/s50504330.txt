Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. Overall cardiacl contour remains stably enlarged likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Patchy bibasilar opacities are again seen which may reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration. Clinical correlation is advised. Low lung volumes with crowding of the vasculature and no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. The right pleural effusion appears smaller but this may be related to differences in positioning.
