Left PICC terminates within the lower superior vena cava. Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position. Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion appears similar compared to the prior study allowing for differences in technique and projection. There is also likely a small right pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis is present, worse on the left than the right. Diffuse haziness of the imaged portion of the upper abdomen may correspond to the presence of ascites.
