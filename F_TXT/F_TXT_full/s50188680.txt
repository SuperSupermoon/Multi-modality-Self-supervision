In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are stable, and widespread pulmonary metastases are similar allowing for technical differences between the exams. Small right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size with adjacent worsening atelectasis and increased elevation of right hemidiaphragm. Linear left basilar atelectasis has improved in the interval and a small left pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size. No other relevant change.
