AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Available for comparison is the next preceding AP and lateral chest examination of ___. Heart size has not changed significantly since the preceding portable examination. Metallic structures of an implantable aortic valve device are now seen in the ___ the heart shadow. Its location is compatible with the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic root, however, patient's slight rotation towards the left accounts for appearance to the left of the spine. The appearance of the lung fields has undergone a dramatic interval change with now diffuse haze superimposed on both lungs. The finding on this portable chest examinations suggests the possibility of advanced pulmonary edema, however, possibility that the patient is in more recumbent position resulting in drift of pleural effusion into the posterior portion of the pleural space could account for this finding. To resolve this question, the performance of a lateral view is recommended.
