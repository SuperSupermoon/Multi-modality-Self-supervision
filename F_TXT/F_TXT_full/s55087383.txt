AP chest compared to ___: Sternum has been re-wired. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. Moderate cardiomegaly and widening of the upper mediastinum are due in part to supine positioning but also reflect a biventricular decompensation or volume overload. There is no definite pneumothorax or anterior pleural air might be missed on this supine view. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the pulmonary outflow tract. ET tube in standard placement. Midline and bilateral pleural drains in place. At least small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, but difficult to recognize in the supine patient. Nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
