The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve surgery. Previously reported postoperative widening of the cardiomediastinal contours has markedly improved. Cardiomediastinal contours are currently slightly wider than on the preoperative radiograph, but within the expected range for postoperative appearance following cardiovascular surgery. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are present, with interval improvement on the left. Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with no visible pneumothorax. Remaining indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position.
