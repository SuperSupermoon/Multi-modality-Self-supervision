AP portable upright view of the chest. Patient's chin obscures the superior mediastinum and portions of the lung apices. The lung volumes are low also limiting evaluation. The heart is moderately enlarged though this appears unchanged. Retrocardiac space is poorly assessed. Otherwise, there is no evidence of pneumonia. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour stable. Bony structures are intact.
