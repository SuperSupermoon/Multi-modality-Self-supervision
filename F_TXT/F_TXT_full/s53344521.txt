Multiple right-sided rib fractures are seen including likely the lateral right third through seventh ribs. Comminuted mid right clavicular fracture is seen. There are relatively low lung volumes. Blunting of the costophrenic angles suggests small pleural effusions, right greater than left. No definite pneumothorax is seen although a small pneumothorax would be difficult to exclude radiographically. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
