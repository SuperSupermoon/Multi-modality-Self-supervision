Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated with dense mitral annular calcifications. Aortic knob calcifications are also re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Consolidative opacity in the right lung base, along with probable patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflect areas of pneumonia or aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Assessment of the left apex is obscured by external devices. Remote posterior rib fracture is again noted.
