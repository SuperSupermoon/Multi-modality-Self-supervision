Compared with the prior film, multiple lines and tubes have been removed, including the left chest tube. Again seen is a right-sided PICC line. The tip is not well visualized, but probably overlies the mid/distal SVC. On the current examination, there is a very small left apical pneumothorax. This is new compared with ___. The possibility of a miniscule left apical pneumothorax on the prior film cannot be entirely excluded. No right-sided pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged. Left and right base opacities are similar to the prior study. Upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring is again seen, possibly slightly improved. Probable small bilateral effusions, grossly similar to the prior study.
