There is a left-sided pacemaker with leads terminating in the right ventricle and right atrium in expected and unchanged positioning. Given slightly low lung volumes, there are no focal consolidations which are concerning for pneumonia. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with cephalization of the vessels but no frank pulmonary edema. There is no large pleural effusion, but small left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. The cardiac size is top normal. No pneumothorax is identified.
