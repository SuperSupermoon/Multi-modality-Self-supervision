The lungs are hyperinflated with relative lucency in the upper lungs, suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary emphysema. Subtle left base opacity may relate to overlapping structures although early consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
