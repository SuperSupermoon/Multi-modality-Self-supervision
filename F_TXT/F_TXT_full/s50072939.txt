There is subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall. There is a consolidation in the left mid and lower lung, which likely represents a combination of hemothorax and atelectasis and contusion from prior injury. Multiple continuous posterior rib fractures are seen in the left, as seen on prior CT. ET tube ends 3.4 cm from the carina. The enteric tube ends in the stomach. No pleural effusion is identified. The right lung is grossly clear. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
