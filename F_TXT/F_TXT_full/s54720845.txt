AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. There is slight interval improvement in widespread parenchymal consolidation that might reflect pulmonary edema. Tubes and lines are in unchanged position as well as the left pleural effusion. Left retrocardiac consolidation may be in part due to relaxation atelectasis, but infectious process in this location cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is seen.
