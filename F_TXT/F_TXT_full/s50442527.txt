There are diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities compatible with interstitial edema. No focal opacities are identified. There might be a small right-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is present. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Bony structures are intact. Multiple monitoring and supporting devices are seen. The endotracheal tube ends 8 mm above the carina. An esophageal tube is bent and ends in the upper esophagus. A right IJ catheter with a transvenous pacer wire is seen entering into the heart and forming long loops. The tip of the transvenous pacer wire is not in optimal position close to the cardiac apex. Other devices appear to be external to the patient.
