In comparison with the study of ___, there is an placement of a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter that extends to the right pulmonary artery. The dense streak of atelectasis in the left mid zone has essentially cleared. Position of the left subclavian catheter is stable, as is the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. . There is increased opacification at the left base with some displacement of the heart to that side. This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe, possibly due to a mucous plugging. Remainder of the study is within normal limits.
