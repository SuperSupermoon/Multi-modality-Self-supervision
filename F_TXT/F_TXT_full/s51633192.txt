Since a recent radiograph from earlier today, the patient has been intubated, with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 2.5 cm above the carina. Exam is otherwise remarkable for apparent increase in size of left pleural effusion with adjacent worsening left retrocardiac atelectasis. Marked distension of bowel loops in the imaged upper abdomen is incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph examination.
