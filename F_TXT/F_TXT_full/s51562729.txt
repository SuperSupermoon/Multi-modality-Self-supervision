Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are stable but there are bibasal opacities that appear to be more pronounced than on the prior study, potentially due to termination of mechanical ventilation, attention to this area on the subsequent studies is recommended. No pneumothorax.
