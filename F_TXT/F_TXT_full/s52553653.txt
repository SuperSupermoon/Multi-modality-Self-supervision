Since the prior exam, the left internal jugular central venous catheter has been repositioned. The tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The other support lines and tubes are unchanged. There is persistent bibasilar atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion. There is no new opacity. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Again, there is subcutaneous air in the soft tissues of the neck, similar to multiple prior exams.
