Single frontal portable view of the chest was obtained. Allowing for patient rotation with respect to the film, the heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Linear opacity in the left lower lobe is compatible with atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Metallic clips are present in the left upper quadrant. Left nephrostomy catheter is incompletely imaged. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
