AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on ___ at 5:29 p.m. The patient is rotated differently as compared to prior study. The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. The right pigtail catheter, the right internal jugular line and NG tube that passes below the diaphragm are all in appropriate positions. Interval increase in pleural effusion on the left is suspected, although it might be related to different rotation of the patient. No definitive pulmonary edema is seen. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
