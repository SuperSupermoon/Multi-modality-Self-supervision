Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are unchanged and compatible with prior CABG. The heart size is large but stable. The mediastinal contours are within expected post-CABG limits. Calcified atherosclerotic disease is present at the aortic knob. The lungs are clear of consolidation but the pulmonary vessels are somewhat indistinct, compatible with mild edema. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
