CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Tracheostomy tube is present. A left subclavian central line is present, tip over distal SVC. No gross pneumothorax. The area of interest at the left lung apex is obscured, limiting assessment for a small ptx. The heart is not enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. There is patchy alveolar opacity in the right cardiophrenic region and increased retrocardiac density, each consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No gross effusion. Compared with ___ at 10:31 a.m., retrocardiac opacity has progressed. Right cardiophrenic opacity is unchanged.
