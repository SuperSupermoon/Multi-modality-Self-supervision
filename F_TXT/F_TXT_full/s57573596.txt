As compared to the previous radiograph, the known lung nodules are unchanged. The largest nodule is seen in the left lung apex. The lung volumes have decreased and pre-existing parenchymal opacities, with a strong interstitial component at both lung bases, have increased in extent and severity. The findings are consistent with recurrent pneumonia or aspiration. Unchanged right apical thickening. Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.
