Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Lines and tubes remain in unchanged position including kinking of the distal large right supraclavicular catheter. Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema is unchanged. Right lower lobe opacities have increased consistent with increased atelectasis. Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved.
