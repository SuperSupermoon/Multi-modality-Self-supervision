In comparison with study of ___, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the lower edge of the stomach. There is continued increased opacification at the right base, though there may be some improved aeration in the region. This suggests a combination of pleural effusion and some residual volume loss.
