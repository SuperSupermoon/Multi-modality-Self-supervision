CHEST, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW. Left-sided chest tube is in place. No supine film evidence of pneumothorax is detected, though a small pneumothorax might not be apparent on a supine film. As before, there is dense increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, small effusion, and more hazy opacity in left upper zone. Possible slight left-sided volume loss. Allowing for low lung volumes, the right lung is grossly clear, without focal infiltrate or effusion. The hila are not well depicted on these views.
