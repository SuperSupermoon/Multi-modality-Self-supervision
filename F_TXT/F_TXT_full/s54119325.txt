The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is similar moderate relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a new widespread moderate interstitial abnormality with perihilar fullness, more extensive on the right than left, but suggestive of moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. This is superimposed on pre-existing right basilar opacities. Relative depression of the right acromion compared to the distal right clavicle appears unchanged and suggests a history of prior shoulder separation.
