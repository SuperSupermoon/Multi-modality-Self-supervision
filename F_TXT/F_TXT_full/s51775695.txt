Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube, right-sided IJ line and feeding tube which are unchanged in position and appropriately sited. There are again seen large bilateral pleural effusions and parenchymal opacities throughout both lung fields. This is stable. There is likely an overlying element of fluid overload. There are no pneumothoraces. Overall, there has been no significant change allowing for differences in patient positioning.
