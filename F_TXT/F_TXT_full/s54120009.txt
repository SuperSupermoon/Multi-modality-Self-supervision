In comparison with study of ___, there has been chest tube inserted with substantial reduction in the amount of free pleural fluid on the right. No convincing evidence of pneumothorax. There is increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with some combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe and left effusion. There is evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
