The previously readily visible bronchial stent in the right main bronchus has been removed since ___. I cannot tell if there is a smaller less radio-opaque stent any where else in the right bronchial tree. There is slightly improved aeration in both the previously collapsed right upper lobe and at the right lung base laterally. Large right hilar mass is more clearly defined. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. Small left pleural effusion may be new. No pneumothorax.
