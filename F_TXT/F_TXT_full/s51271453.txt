The lungs continue to be under inflated without pneumothorax, pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. Bilateral degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joints continue to be seen. A new left mid lung opacity is seen when compared to the most recent chest radiograph. Retrocardiac opacities likely represent atelectasis.
