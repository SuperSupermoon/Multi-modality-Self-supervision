AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. The frontal view AP chest image does not disclose any pneumothorax in this patient who recently has undergone revision of failing permanent pacer. Comparison is made with a previous study. One can also identify that a new different type pacemaker capsule has been inserted. A new third electrode reaches in a position compatible with apical portion of the right ventricle. Noteworthy is that the previously present remains in unchanged position with its tip, a finding which also holds for the right atrial electrode. Unfortunately, there are multiple probably external wires overlying the area making interpretation uncertain.
