Single portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 5.7 cm from the carina. Left-sided internal jugular line is seen with course projecting laterally and tip over the axillary region. Enteric tube is seen passing below the diaphragm, although the tip is not clearly delineated and potentially off the inferior field of view. Left-sided pleural catheter is identified at the lung base. There is dense retrocardiac opacity which could be due to any combination of effusion, consolidation or infection. Elsewhere, there is mild pulmonary edema.
