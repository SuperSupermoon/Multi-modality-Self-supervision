AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Patient is now intubated, the ETT seen to terminate in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina. A temporary pacing wire has been introduced via the right internal jugular approach and is seen to terminate position compatible with the apical portion of the right ventricle after the line past apparently markedly dilated right atrium. Metallic grid structures of a CoreValve prosthesis are identified and seen to overlie the area of the aortic valve and ascending aorta. The grids pattern of the stent extends however high into the ascending aorta and appears superimposed on the aortic arch. There is no pneumothorax. Comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___, the pulmonary vascular pattern demonstrates more congestion, with bilateral central pulmonary edema. Amount of pleural effusions blunting the lateral pleural sinuses remain unaltered.
