In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a left chest tube. There has been improved expansion of the left hemithorax, though it is difficult to unequivocally exclude a small pneumothorax due to overlying bony structures an external devices in the region. The endotracheal tube has been repositioned so that the tip lies approximately 2 cm above the carina. Lower lung volumes, but otherwise little change.
