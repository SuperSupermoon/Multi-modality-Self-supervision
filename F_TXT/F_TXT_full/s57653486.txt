In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Some elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen. The right heart border and hemidiaphragm are more sharply seen, consistent with some improvement in volume loss and fluid at the right base. The left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, suggesting some improved aeration of the left lower lobe. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle persists. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, accentuated by low lung volumes. Only mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Multiple fractures of the uppermost two sternal wires are of long duration.
