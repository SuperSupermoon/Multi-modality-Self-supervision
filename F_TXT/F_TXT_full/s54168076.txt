Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates bilateral parenchymal opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, which is slightly improved from the prior study. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or consolidation. The endotracheal tube tip is obscured by overlying sternotomy wires. A left-sided internal jugular line ends in the persistent left SVC. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.
