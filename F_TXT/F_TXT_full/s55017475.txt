AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Available for comparison is the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. During the latest examination interval, the patient has undergone an intravascular placement of a CoreValve. The patient is now intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular approach wire has been placed, seen to terminate in the apical portion of the right ventricle, thus representing a temporary pacing wire. The grid structures of a CoreValve device are seen in expected location covering the outflow tract of the left ventricle and the root of the aorta. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion similar as such finding was absent on the preceding chest examination of ___. A now present diffuse haze over the entire right-sided hemithorax can be explained by patient's previously identified right-sided basal pleural effusion which is now layering in the posterior compartments of the pleural space as the patient is in supine position. No pneumothorax can be identified on either side.
