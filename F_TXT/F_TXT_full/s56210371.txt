The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contour is stable. Again appreciated is a right central venous catheter unchanged in position with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Again noted are bibasilar and retrocardiac opacities greater on the right versus the left. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. No acute bony changes are identified.
