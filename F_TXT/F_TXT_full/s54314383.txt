AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day. The patient is intubated, the ETT in unchanged position terminating some 5 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. Previously described patchy infiltrates mostly located to the lower lung areas persist and may even have increased. Superimposed on these findings, there is now a further increasing congested vascular pattern with perivascular haze and indistinct delineation of the vasculature. This finding is strongly suggestive of progressive pulmonary edema superimposed on inflammatory infiltrates. Similar as on the preceding study, distended large bowel loops are noted but there is no evidence of free gas under the diaphragms.
