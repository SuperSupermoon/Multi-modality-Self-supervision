Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is a large right pneumothorax with collapse of the right lung. There may be slight widening of the right rib interspaces and minimal downward displacement of the right hemidiaphragm which could represent very minimal tension. Otherwise, the mediastinal structures are relatively midline. The left lung is clear.
