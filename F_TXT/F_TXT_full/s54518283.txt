The known left pneumothorax has increased in size and a right upper lobe atelectasis is now present. There is unchanged evidence of moderate cardiomegaly and minimal shift of the mediastinum towards the right, that could be interpreted as early sign of tension. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Findings were immediately communicated by telephone at the time of discovery.
