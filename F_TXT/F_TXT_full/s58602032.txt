Left-sided central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Endotracheal tube terminates 5.3 cm above the Carina. Enteric tube is visualized only in the upper mediastinum and not seen clearly, likely due to underpenetration. There is interval worsening of bilateral perihilar and lower lobe opacities with cardiomegaly compatible with worsening pulmonary edema. Likely bilateral small pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Bony thorax is unchanged.
