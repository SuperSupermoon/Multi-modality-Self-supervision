In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 3 days prior, there has been interval advancement of the Dobhoff tube into the small bowel and outside the field of view. A moderate, right pleural effusion has increased with substantial, adjacent, right middle and lower lobe compressive atelectasis. Previously noted right upper lobe consolidation has completely resolved. Left pleural effusion small, if any. Lungs otherwise well expanded and clear without focal consolidation.
