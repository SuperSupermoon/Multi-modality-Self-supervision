Interval placement of an endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.9 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube is in place coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not well seen. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Left perihilar opacity persists. Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature again may be due to mild fluid overload. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
