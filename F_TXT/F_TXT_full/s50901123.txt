Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on ___ at 04:32 a.m. Currently, there is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with left mediastinal shift as well as triangular opacity in the right upper lung, finding consistent with interval development of complete left lung atelectasis and right upper lobe atelectasis. Only right mid and lower lobes of the lung are currently opacified. Subsequent examination demonstrated intubation with interval improvement of the situation.
