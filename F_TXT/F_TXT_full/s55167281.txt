Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates decreased right upper lobe opacifications as well as decreased central lucent cavity. However, there has been interval increase in size of the right middle lobe opacification with greater lateral expansion of consolidation and with a greater area of central lucency. No pneumothorax evident. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely represents a new small pleural effusion. Cardiac size is not enlarged.
