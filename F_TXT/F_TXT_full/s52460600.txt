Single portable view of the chest demonstrates a nasogastric tube coursing through the esophagus, below the diaphragm, with tip terminating in the fundus of the stomach. The cardiomediastinal silhouette demonstrates a tortuous aorta, but is otherwise unremarkable. The lung volumes are relatively low, but demonstrate no focal opacity, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is present. Cholecystectomy clips are seen projecting over the right upper quadrant.
