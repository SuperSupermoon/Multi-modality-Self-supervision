Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given portable technique. Slightly diminished lung volumes with right basilar patchy opacity most likely reflecting atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
