AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Marked cardiac enlargement as before. Pulmonary vascular pattern is extremely congested and mostly centrally located parenchymal densities are rather typical for pulmonary edema. There are in addition some patchy infiltrates mostly in the right hemithorax which raises the possibility of superimposed infectious processes. Comparison with the next preceding study of ___, aeration of the left hemithorax lower area appears to have improved slightly. Comparison is extended to the portable chest examination of ___, at which time bilateral central pulmonary edema pattern was even more marked. A right internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged position terminating in the mid portion of the SVC as before on ___.
