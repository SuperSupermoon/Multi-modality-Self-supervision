Single portable supine frontal image of the chest. There are low lung volumes. Pulmonary vascular congestion is present. There is mild to moderate pulmonary interstitial opacities, probably reflecting pulmonary edmea, but cannot rule out atypical pneumonia. No focal consolidation or mass is seen. The bilateral costophrenic angles are blunted, suggestive of small bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is top-normal in size.
