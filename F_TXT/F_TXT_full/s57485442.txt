Sternotomy. Very shallow inspiration accentuates heart size, with underlying increased heart size and pulmonary vascularity, more prominent since prior. Bilateral perihilar opacities, with component of atelectasis, consider edema. Left lower lobe consolidation is new, likely atelectasis, with probable small left pleural effusion. Right infrahilar opacity is likely atelectasis in the setting of elevated right hemidiaphragm, consider infection if clinically appropriate. There may be small right pleural effusion. Elevated right hemidiaphragm is more prominent, likely from shallow inspiration. No pneumothorax.
