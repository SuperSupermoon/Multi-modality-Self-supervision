AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions are increased in size from ___ through ___, subsequently stable. Rightward mediastinal shift over the past 24 hours is probably a function of worsening atelectasis in the right lung, particularly of the lower lobe. Obliteration of the lumen in the right bronchial tree below the upper lobe origin suggests retained secretions. Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements respectively, as is a nasogastric tube ending in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at 11:40, at the time of recognition of these radiographic findings.
