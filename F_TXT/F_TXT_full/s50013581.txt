NG tube is seen with tip in the fundus of the stomach and side port at the level of the GE junction. ET tube is in appropriate position with tip 3 cm above the level of the carina. The lungs are well expanded. Linear opacity in the left lower lobe likely represents atelectasis, however, may represent aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. The right pleural surface is clear. The left costophrenic angle is not fully imaged; however, no large pleural effusion seen. No pneumothorax. Mildly enlarged heart is likely attributed to AP technique and supine positioning. Mediastinal contour and hila are normal. Medialization of aortic arch calcifications without irregularity of the aortic knob contour or apical cap is of unclear significance.
