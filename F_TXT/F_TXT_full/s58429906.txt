2 portable views of the chest. There is a new right-sided IJ central venous catheter with tip at the RA/SVC junction or within the upper right atrium. Mild bibasilar opacities are seen although somewhat less conspicuous at the right lung base when compared to earlier chest x-ray. There is no pneumothorax. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
