As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a right thoracocentesis. The pre-existing extensive right pleural effusion is substantially decreased. The remaining effusion is restricted to the region of the right costophrenic sinus. No evidence of pneumothorax. Predominantly reticular opacities at the right lung base, likely reflecting re-expansion edema. Unchanged massive cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis. The ventilated lung areas on the left are unremarkable. Unchanged position of pacemaker leads.
