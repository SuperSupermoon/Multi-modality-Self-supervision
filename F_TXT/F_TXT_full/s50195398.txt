Again cardiomegaly is present but stable. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Perihilar right-sided opacities appear more prominent than on the prior study and may represent aspiration given the patients history. Low lung volumes and the patient's rotation could also account for this apparent increase. No fractures. There is no pulmonary edema.
