In comparison with the study of ___, there has been the development of extensive opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm and heart border. This is consistent with some combination of pleural effusion, extensive volume loss, and even superimposed pneumonia. Central catheter remains in place. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Less prominent changes are seen at the right base.
