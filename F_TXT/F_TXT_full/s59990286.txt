No airspace opacity concerning for pneumonia is identified. Single semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates the lungs are well expanded, with no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature is unchanged compared to multiple prior studies. The heart size is mild to moderately enlarged. Calcifications are noted in the aortic arch. A prominent right pulmonary artery is also unchanged. A right approach PICC terminates in the mid SVC, and a jejunostomy tube, right upper quadrant embolization coils, and a plastic common bile duct stent are noted in the abdomen.
