A newly placed left pectoral cardiac AICD has leads projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged. New hazy opacification of the partially obscured left lung may be due to a layering effusion (hemorrhagic or serous) or atelectasis. The right lung remains clear. There is no pneumothorax. Regional bones and soft tissues are unremarkable.
