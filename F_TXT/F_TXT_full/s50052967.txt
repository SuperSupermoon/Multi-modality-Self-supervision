There is redemonstration of a pigtail drainage catheter at the right lung base with adjacent right infrahilar opacity, similar in appearance to prior study. Persistent widespread parenchymal consolidations are slightly increased in density, compatible with worsening edema. Small right effusion is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Esophageal stent is unchanged and appears patent.
