Heart size is top normal. The aorta remains unfolded. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with previously noted elevated left hilus appearing improved. Known mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy is better appreciated on the recent chest CT. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. There are minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases as well as linear opacity in the left upper lung field likely reflective of atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
