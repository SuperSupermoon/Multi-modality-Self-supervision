AP chest compared to ___: The lung volumes have improved following intubation, there is greater consolidation at both lung bases medially. Whether this is pneumonia or atelectasis due to retained secretions is radiographically indeterminate. Upper lobe vasculature is mildly engorged, but this is not a pattern of pulmonary edema. Heart size is normal. At least small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax.
