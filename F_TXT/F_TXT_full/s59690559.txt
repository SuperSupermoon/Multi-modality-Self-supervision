AP chest compared to ___ at 3:59 a.m.: Moderate right pleural effusion is larger now than earlier in the day, but there is no other change. Right lung base is essentially obscured by the elevated hemidiaphragm and overlying effusion, probably substantially atelectatic. Heart is severely enlarged. Upper lungs are grossly clear and there is no left pleural effusion. Left subclavian line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins. No pneumothorax. Thoracic aorta is very tortuous and generally large but probably not focally aneurysmal.
