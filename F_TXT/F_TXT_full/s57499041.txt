1. Left subclavian central line is unchanged in position with its tip in the mid SVC. A right chest tube remains in place and there continues to be loculated right apical pneumothorax with some adjacent chain sutures and surgical clips in the right suprahilar region, suggestive of a prior right upper lobectomy. Subcutaneous emphysema is also visualized within the lateral chest and neck soft tissues. The remaining right visualized lung and left lung are grossly clear. There is some elevation and tenting the right hemidiaphragm, likely related to the volume loss from the surgery. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
