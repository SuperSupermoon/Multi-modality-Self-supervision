The initial radiograph of 08:34 shows interval removal of the nasogastric tube. Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. Bilateral pigtail catheters are unchanged in position. An endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. A left IJ central venous catheter terminates at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate right and small left layering pleural effusions are slightly increased on the right. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is also unchanged. An unchanged retrocardiac airspace opacity may either be due to infection or atelectasis. The followup radiograph of 10:17 shows interval placement of a feeding tube, which enters the stomach. Aeration at the left lung base continues to improve. There is no other significant interval change.
