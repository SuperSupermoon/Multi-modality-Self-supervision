Nasogastric tube has been advanced, with distal tip directed cephalad within the fundus. Left chest tube remains in place with the tip terminating in a midline position. Small left apical pneumothorax is in retrospect unchanged since the prior study, and there has been overall little change in the appearance of the chest except for slight improved aeration at both lung bases.
