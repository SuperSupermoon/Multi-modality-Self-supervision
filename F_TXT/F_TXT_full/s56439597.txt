There are low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, there is persistent mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Left perihilar opacities are seen, which are nonspecific but could be due to infection or aspiration. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Degenerative changes are partially imaged at the right greater than left shoulder joints.
