AP portable view of the chest. Lung volumes are markedly low limiting assessment. Additionally, the patient's chin projecting over the superior mediastinum and lung apices limits assessment. There is chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. The left upper lung appears grossly well aerated. There is significant opacification of the right hemi thorax which is concerning for pneumonia given the presence of subtle air bronchograms. A subjacent right effusion is suspected. Heart size cannot be assessed. Prominence of the mediastinum is again noted. Chronic right clavicle deformity noted. No acute bony abnormalities.
