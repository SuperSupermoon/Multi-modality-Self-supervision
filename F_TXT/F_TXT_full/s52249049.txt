Irregular opacification at the lung apices, and a 17 mm wide nodular opacity at the left apex particularly, should be compared with the appearance on prior chest radiographs to see if this is an active process requiring further evaluation with chest CT scanning. Lower lungs are clear and there is no pleural abnormality. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
