AP portable upright view of the chest. The heart is mildly enlarged. An ill-defined retrocardiac left basilar opacity can reflect any combination of patient positioning, atelectasis, and small effusion, though focal consolidation cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax or right effusion. A right-sided thoracostomy tube is present. A nasogastric or orogastric tube appears to terminate at the level of the diaphragm.
