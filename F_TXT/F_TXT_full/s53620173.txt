In comparison to the most recent prior study, there are increased focal airspace opacities in the right and left lung base greater on the right, concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are not excluded on this single frontal view. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. Mediastinal contours are prominent, related in part to unfolding of the thoracic aorta, but otherwise unchanged. The trachea is deviated to the right by the aortic knob. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. A type 3 acromioclavicular dislocation is redemonstrated on the right.
