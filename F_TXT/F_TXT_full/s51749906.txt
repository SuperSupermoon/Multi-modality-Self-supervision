1. Right internal jugular central line with its tip in the distal superior vena cava. Persistent low lung volumes with worsening opacities at both bases with associated indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity. Therefore, I would favor the presence of pulmonary edema rather than an infectious process. Clinical correlation, however is advised. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given low lung volumes and patient rotation on the current examination. Clips within the left upper quadrant are again seen.
