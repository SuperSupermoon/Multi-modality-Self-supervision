As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a mild-to-moderate newly appeared right pleural effusion. The left retrocardiac atelectasis is constant in appearance. The endotracheal tube has been slightly pulled back, the nasogastric tube is in the stomach, with the sidehole projecting over the gastroesophageal junction. The line should be slightly advanced to ensure safe position within the stomach. The position of the right internal jugular vein catheter is unchanged. The mediastinum is less dense and slightly more narrow than on the previous image. No pneumothorax is visible. No new parenchymal opacities.
