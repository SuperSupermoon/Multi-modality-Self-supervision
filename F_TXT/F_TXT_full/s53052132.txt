Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. ET tube is in standard position. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the upper SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach but the side hole is at the GE junction and should be advanced at least 7 cm for more standard position. Right basal consolidation consistent with aspiration is grossly unchanged from prior. Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
