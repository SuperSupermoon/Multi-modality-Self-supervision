1. Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach but the side port near the gastroesophageal junction, unchanged. Endotracheal tube has the tip approximately 2 cm above the carina, also unchanged. Findings were previously conveyed to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___, on ___ at 12:37 p.m. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There continue to be bullous changes at both apices with parenchymal distortion throughout both lungs suggestive of underlying fibrotic lung disease, possibly related to emphysema. In addition, the superimposed patchy opacities do not appear to be significantly changed and could reflect superimposed edema or an infectious process. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pneumothorax. No large pleural effusions.
