As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are constant. The lung parenchyma has improved regarding radiolucency, likely reflecting improved ventilation. There is unchanged evidence of increased opacity at the medial right lung bases, small pleural effusion on the left lung and an area of retrocardiac atelectasis. No new parenchymal opacity. Soft tissue air collection in both chest walls persists.
