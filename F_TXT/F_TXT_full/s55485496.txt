A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged from the prior study. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable from the prior exam. A left basal opacity is similar in character to the prior radiograph and likely represents a layering left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax identified. The osseous structures are grossly normal.
