Left PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC. Large right pleural effusion appears slightly increased in size compared to the previous exam with associated right basilar atelectasis. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear grossly unchanged. Patchy opacity within the left mid lung field appears new and is concerning for an area of developing infection. There is no left-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
