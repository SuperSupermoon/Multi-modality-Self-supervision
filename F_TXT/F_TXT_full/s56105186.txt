As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial decrease of the right pleural effusion after thoracocentesis. The remaining effusion is limited to the costophrenic sinus. There is mild opacity at the right lung base, potentially representing re-expansion edema. The right lung shows no pneumothorax. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis.
