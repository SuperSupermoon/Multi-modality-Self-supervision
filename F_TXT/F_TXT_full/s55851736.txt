Increased densities in the right lower lobe may be compatible with pneumonia in the correct clinical setting. Less so but still present increased densities are also noted in the left lower lobe, although these appear slightly more streaky possibly compatible with atelectasis. Heart size is normal. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or overt pulmonary edema. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
