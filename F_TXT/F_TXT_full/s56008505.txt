There is at least moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The hila are unremarkable. Bilateral airspace opacities with a central predominance likely reflects pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema, although superimposed infection is difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
