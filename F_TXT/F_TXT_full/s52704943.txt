Right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter is new, and its insertion presumably explains new subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall. There is no appreciable right pleural fluid collection. Previous multiloculated right pneumothorax is much smaller. Atelectasis at the right lung base has changed in distribution but probably not in overall severity. Left lung volume is lower but aside from linear scar atelectasis there is no focal abnormality. Heart size normal. 4 cm wide opacity in the right upper chest probably a hematoma or mycetoma in the right pleural space was smaller on ___.
