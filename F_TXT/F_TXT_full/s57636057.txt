AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes remain quite low. Previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved, but severe bibasilar atelectasis has not. There may be small-to-moderate accompanying bilateral pleural effusions, not appreciably changed over the past several days. Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size which is top normal. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC. Nasogastric tube ends in the mid portion of the stomach moderately distended with air and fluid, but not nearly as dilated as it has been recently. No pneumothorax.
