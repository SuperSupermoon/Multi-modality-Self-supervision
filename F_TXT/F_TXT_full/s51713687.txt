Opacities in the right lower lobe and left upper lung represent a combination of the known lesions and post biopsy bleeding. An oxygen mask obscures the right lung apex where there may be a small pneumothorax. No left pneumothorax. No pleural effusion. There is elevation of left hemidiaphragm from a massively distended, air-filled stomach. No focal airspace consolidation worrisome for infection. Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged. A marked dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is long-standing.
