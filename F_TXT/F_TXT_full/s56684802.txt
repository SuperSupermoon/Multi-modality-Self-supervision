1. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the superior vena cava. 2. Bibasilar airspace opacity likely reflects a combination of layering effusions and compressive atelectasis and is essentially unchanged in appearance. Perihilar vessels appear cephalized raising the possibility of pulmonary venous hypertension. No overt pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
