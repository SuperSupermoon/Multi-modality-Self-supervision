There are relatively low lung volumes. Subtle small nodular opacities noted at the left upper lung and possibly right lung base are nonspecific and of uncertain chronicity, given lack of priors for comparison. Recommend comparison with any prior studies, if none consider nonurgent chest CT for further assessment if clinically appropriate given patient age. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. More focal lateral right base opacity could be due to scarring but underlying pulmonary nodule or focal consolidation is not excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral views the chest would be helpful for further assessment if/when patient able. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette size is top-normal. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Subtle deformities of several lateral mid to lower right ribs are of indeterminate age, but could be due to prior fractures.
