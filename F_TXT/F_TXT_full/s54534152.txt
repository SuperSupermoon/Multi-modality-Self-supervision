Lung volumes are low. Heart size is at least moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, more focal in the left lung base likely reflecting areas of atelectasis. No Large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Evidence of prior kyphoplasty is seen within the upper lumbar spine.
