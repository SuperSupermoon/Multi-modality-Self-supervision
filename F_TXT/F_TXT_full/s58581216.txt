There is no evidence of left pneumothorax following a bronchoscopic biopsy of a left lower lobe mass. New left lower lobe consolidation is present, and could reflect post-procedural hemorrhage, aspiration and/or lavage fluid. Focal opacity at right lung base is also noted and is likely due to atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
