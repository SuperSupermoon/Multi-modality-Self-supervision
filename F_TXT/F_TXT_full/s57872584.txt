As compared to ___ radiograph, widespread subcutaneous emphysema has worsened in severity, and pneumomediastinum has also slightly worsened. Bilateral chest tubes remain in place with small to moderate bilateral pneumothoraces extending into the deep regions of the costophrenic sulci bilaterally. Is difficult to fully exclude the possibility of free intraperitoneal air, and additional lateral decubitus radiograph could be helpful in this regard if warranted clinically. Diffuse reticular and ground-glass opacities may be due to history of ARDS, although atypical/opportunistic infection and pulmonary hemorrhage are additional considerations. Note is also made of findings suggestive of pulmonary interstitial emphysema.
