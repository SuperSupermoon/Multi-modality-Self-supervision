As compared to the previous image, the right chest tube is in unchanged position. The pre-existing diffuse parenchymal opacities on the right have substantially improved and are now visible only at the right lung base and at the right lung apex. The perihilar lung regions are substantially better ventilated than on the previous image. Moderate cardiomegaly and elongation of the descending aorta. Platelike areas of atelectasis at the left lung bases. Otherwise normal left lung. Substantial decrease in extent of the soft tissue air collections in the cervical region.
