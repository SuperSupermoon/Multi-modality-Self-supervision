Lung volumes remain low. There is increasing consolidation in the retrocardiac region which is likely associated with a layering effusion. Although these findings could represent compressive atelectasis of the left lower low, pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered in the correct clinical setting. Patchy opacity at the right base is stable favoring atelectasis. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
