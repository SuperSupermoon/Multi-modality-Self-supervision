In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged. There is minimal elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with pleural fluid and underlying compressive atelectasis. No definite acute focal pneumonia.
