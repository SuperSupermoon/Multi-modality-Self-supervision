Compared with the prior radiograph, there are new bilateral pulmonary alveolar opacities, most pronounced in the right lower lung, as well as increased interstitial lung markings, consistent with pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also seen. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Central venous catheter is also unchanged is position, with its tip at the level of the right ventricle. A large hiatal hernia is not as well seen as the prior study, but also present.
