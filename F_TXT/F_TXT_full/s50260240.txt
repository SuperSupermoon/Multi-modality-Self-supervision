Low lung volumes persists. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is re- demonstrated with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, and are not substantially changed in the interval. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or definite large pneumothorax is seen. Please note that the lung apices are somewhat obscured by the patient's neck soft tissues projecting over these regions. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
