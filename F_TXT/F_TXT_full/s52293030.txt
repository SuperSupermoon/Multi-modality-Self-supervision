There has been prior stent graft repair of the aortic arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta. Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged from the prior radiograph. Opacification of the left lung base is likely a function of atelectasis and pleural fluid. No new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
