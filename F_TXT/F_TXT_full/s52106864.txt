AP chest compared to ___: The lower component of pleural fluid loculation in the right hemithorax decreased dramatically following insertion of the right pigtail pleural drainage catheter, and has not changed since ___. The superior component; however, which is probably mostly posterior, is slightly larger today than it was on ___ or ___. There is no pneumothorax. The right pleural drainage catheter could have a relatively short intrathoracic excursion given that the most distal loop appears to project outside the intercostal plane. Lateral view would be helpful in determining the extent of intrathoracic tubing. Considerable atelectasis is expected at the base of the right lung and this would obscure consolidation there. The left lung is entirely clear. Heart size is normal. Small loculations of pleural air in the right upper chest laterally have not changed appreciably since ___.
