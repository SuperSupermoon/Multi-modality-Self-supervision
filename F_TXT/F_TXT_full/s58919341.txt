Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 07:32 a.m. The intra-aortic balloon pump tip is lower, located approximately 2.8 cm below the roof of the aortic arch. The Swan-Ganz catheter inserted through the femoral approach terminates what appears to be left lower lobe pulmonary artery. Surrounding opacity might reflect pulmonary edema, but in part may be die to pulmonary infarct due to too deep position of the intra-arterial catheter. Pulmonary edema, bilateral right more than left pleural effusions are unchanged. Infectious process, as part of the left perihilar opacity is a possibility, and attention to this area is required.
