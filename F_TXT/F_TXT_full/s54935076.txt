Evaluation is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. Tracheostomy tube, left subclavian central venous catheter, and enteric tube appears stable. Linear opacities in the left lower lobe appears stable and likely represent a combination of bronchial wall thickening related to known bronchiectasis in the region as well as linear atelectasis and scarring. Left upper lobe opacity has also remained stable. Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains stable. The aorta appears tortuous. No areas of consolidation to suggest acute pneumonia.
