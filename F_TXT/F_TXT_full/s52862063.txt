As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have minimally decreased, potentially reflecting decreased ventilatory pressure. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant. There is unchanged evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and of bilateral areas of atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. The presence of a minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
