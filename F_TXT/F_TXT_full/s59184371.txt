A moderate diffuse interstitial abnormality, more severe in the right lung than the left, is similar in appearance to the prior radiograph. The abnormality is similarly to perhaps slightly more prominent that the prior study, although this may be due to the difference in the penetration of the image. These abnormalities are likely for the most part due to the patient's underlying chronic interstitial lung disease. There is no definite evidence of pulmonary edema, although small component of new pulmonary edema cannot be fully excluded given the very abnormal underlying lung. No focal consolidation is present. No definite pleural effusions are present. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and unchanged.
