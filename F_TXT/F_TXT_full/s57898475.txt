Lung volumes are lower which may account for the suggestion of new mild edema in the left upper lobe. Oblique views were recommended to evaluate an unusual ring shadows seen on yesterday's chest radiographs. Heart is mildly enlarged. Right lung is grossly clear. New right jugular line ends in the right brachiocephalic vein. No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. No right pleural effusion is present.
