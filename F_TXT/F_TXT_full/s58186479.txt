1. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. There is a nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. 2. There is likely persistent left lower lobe collapse. There also are patchy opacities within both lungs which may represent areas of edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, aspiration or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There is likely a small left pleural effusion. Bones are osteopenic. There is narrowing of the right acromiohumeral distance which likely reflects chronic rotator cuff tear as well as superimposed degenerative changes. The left humeral head has either been resected or has resorbed due to remote trauma.
