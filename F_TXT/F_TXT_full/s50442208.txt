Compared with the prior study, a right-sided chest tube has since been placed at the right lung base. The previously seen right pleural effusion is markedly smaller, nearly completely resolved. There is minimal residual collapse and/or consolidation at the right lung base. Hyperlucency at the right lung base likely represents a small basilar pneumothorax. Again seen is pleural fluid and/or thickening extending from the right lung apex along the right lateral chest wall, unchanged. There is minimal atelectasis at the left lung base with blunting of left costophrenic angle unchanged. No overt CHF. Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.
