A single frontal supine image of the chest was obtained. The patient is extremely rotated, limiting evaluation. There is no definite consolidation or pulmonary edema. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Within the limitations of the supine technique, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The trachea is diffusely calcified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well evaluated due to rotation, although no gross abnormalities are identified.
