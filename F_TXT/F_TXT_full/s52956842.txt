AP chest compared to ___: The patient was clearly in pulmonary edema with an increase in earlier cardiomegaly and at least moderate right pleural effusion on ___. These recurred on ___, and has subsequently improved. Nevertheless moderate cardiomegaly is as pronounced as it has recently been and there is a still more severe abnormality in the lower lungs which are densely consolidated, making it difficult to distinguish dependent edema from pneumonia. Small-to-moderate pleural effusions are present. ET tube, upper enteric drainage tube, and a right jugular dual-channel catheter are in standard placements respectively. No pneumothorax. Note, regions of presumed bronchopneumonia seen on the CTA ___ are too small to reliably identify on bedside radiographs. For that reason, when feasible, conventional radiographs should be performed.
