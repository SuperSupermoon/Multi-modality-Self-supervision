There is a new asymmetric perihilar opacification of the right mid lung. This is superimposed on moderate bilateral pleural effusions, similar to increased on the right and perhaps somewhat decreased on the left. Increased opacification at the right lung base may also reflect increasing atelectasis associated with a pleural effusion, although an area of infection is not excluded. Pulmonary vessels show upper zone redistribution and Kerley lines are present suggesting coinciding mild congestive heart failure but generally similar in extent.
