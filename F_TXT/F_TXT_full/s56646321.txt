A skin fold projecting over the left lateral chest should not be mistaken for pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and possibly mild pulmonary edema. Heterogeneous appearance of the lower lungs particularly the right could be due to chronic lung disease, but would make it difficult to detect early pneumonia. There is no pneumonia in the upper lungs. Small right pleural effusion is likely.
