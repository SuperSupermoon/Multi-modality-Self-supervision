Compared to prior chest radiographs most recent ___. Right IJ line ends in the upper right atrium. Although the upper mediastinum is widened, there is no leftward displacement of the trachea to raise strong suspicion for mediastinal hematoma. The findings could be due instead to dilated mediastinal veins ended large aorta, but should be re-evaluated with conventional radiographs when feasible. There is no pneumothorax. The base of the aerated right lung is markedly elevated. I can't tell whether that is the right hemidiaphragm which was elevated to a lesser degree in ___ or whether there is also subpulmonic right pleural effusion or even lobar collapse. Cardiac silhouette is substantially larger, due to moderate cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion and there is mild pulmonary edema in the left lung.
