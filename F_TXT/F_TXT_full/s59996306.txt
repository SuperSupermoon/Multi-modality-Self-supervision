Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. The pulmonary edema has markedly improved, now mild to moderate. Residual persistent right upper, mid, and lower lobe opacities and left upper lobe opacities could be due to residual asymmetric pulmonary edema or a combination of this and either contusions or aspiration pneumonia. Right subclavian catheter tip is at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. There is no evident large pneumothorax. Two right chest tubes and one left chest tube are in place. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at 10:35 a.m., 5 minutes after the discovery of the findings.
