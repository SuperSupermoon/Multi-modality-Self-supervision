In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is substantial widening of the superior mediastinum. Although possibly positional, the possibility of a mediastinal hemorrhage or aortic dissection would have to be considered. If these are serious clinical concerns, CT would be strongly recommended. This information was telephoned to the student on call in the CCU immediately upon discovery by the resident on call. There is some hazy opacification of the left hemithorax that could represent layering effusion. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side hole lies above the cardioesophageal junction. Endotracheal tube is in good position.
