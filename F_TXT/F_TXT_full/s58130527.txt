In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral pulmonary opacifications, worse on the left, have substantially cleared. The right hemidiaphragm is sharply seen, though there is still silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm with hazy opacification at the base, consistent with layering pleural he fusion. Substantial opacification symmetrically involve the apical region, but there is no evidence of acute pneumothorax.
