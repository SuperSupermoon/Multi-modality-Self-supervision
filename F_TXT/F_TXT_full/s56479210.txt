Lung volumes are low. There are medial right middle lobe and retrocardiac opacities. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears similar to the prior examination. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. Apparent increase in heart size may be due to patient positioning and low lung volumes. The aortic knob is densely calcified.
