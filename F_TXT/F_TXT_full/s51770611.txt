Lung volumes remain low. No consolidation or pleural effusion seen. A linear lucency at the periphery of the right lung base is likely due to an overlapping skin fold, this would be an unusual appearance for a pneumothorax but attention to this area on subsequent chest radiographs is recommended. Right basilar atelectasis. Previous median sternotomy noted.
