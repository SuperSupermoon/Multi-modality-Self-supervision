Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC. The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar areas of atelectasis are noted, unchanged. On the other hand, there are new right upper lobe opacities that might reflect most likely atelectasis or worsening infectious process. The interstitial pulmonary edema is at least moderate and slightly progressed since the prior study.
