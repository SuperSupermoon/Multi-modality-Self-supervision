An NG or OG type tube is present. The tip and side port extend beneath the diaphragm and overlie the expected location of the stomach. Otherwise, allowing for considerable differences in technique/beam angulation, I doubt significant interval change. Possibility of slight increase in the degree of pulmonary vascular plethora would be difficult to exclude.
