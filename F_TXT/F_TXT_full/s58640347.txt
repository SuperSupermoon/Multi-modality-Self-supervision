Rotated positioning. An enteric type tube is present, with radiopaque tip overlying the distal stomach. A left subclavian central line is present, tip overlying distal SVC. There is probably an ET tube present. The ET tube tip is poorly visualized due to overlying structures, but it appears to lie at the level of the lower clavicular heads, approximately 6.6 cm above the carina, similar to the prior film. Compared with the prior film, there is new hazy opacity at the right base, which appears to represent a small to moderate size pleural effusion. Underlying collapse and/or consolidation cannot be excluded. There is also increased retrocardiac opacification, with new obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
