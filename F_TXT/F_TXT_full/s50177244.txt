Multiple pulmonary masses overall unchanged since the prior study with no new consolidations or new pleural effusion demonstrated. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall no definitive evidence of new process demonstrated but airway involvement by the metastatic disease cannot be assessed on the chest radiograph in would require assessment with cross-sectional imaging. Chest CT from ___ has demonstrated potentially invasion of the left upper lobe bronchus by the mass which might serve as a source of hemoptysis as well as extensive lymphadenopathy in the right hilus. If clinically warranted, reassessment with repeated chest CT O potentially CT angiography is to be considered if clinically indicated.
