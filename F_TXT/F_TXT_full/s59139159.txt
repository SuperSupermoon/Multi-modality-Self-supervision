There is a left sided catheter projecting over the left apex with evacuation of apical effusion and small collection of residual air. Unchanged left basilar opacity obscures the hemidiaphragm, likely secondary to fluid and/or atelectasis. Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is no new area of consolidation.
