1. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tips projecting over the stomach. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular central line now has its tip in the mid to distal superior vena cava. 2. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Interval worsening of mild to moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema. Small layering effusions and increasing retrocardiac consolidation which may represent an area of compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical correlation is advised. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given marked patient rotation to the right on the current examination.
