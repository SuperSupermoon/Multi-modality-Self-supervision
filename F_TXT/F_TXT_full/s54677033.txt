Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Heterogeneous opacities in the periphery of the right mid and lower lung show interval worsening in the mid lung region, but improvement in the lower lung region. Pleural and parenchymal scarring in left hemithorax appears similar. Small right pleural effusion has apparently slightly decreased in size. No visible pneumothorax.
