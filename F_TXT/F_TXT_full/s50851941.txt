AP portable upright view of the chest. A chest tube is seen projecting over the left hemidiaphragm though its exact position is difficult to assess on this single frontal portable radiograph. The left lung is significantly re-expanded when compared with the prior CT performed earlier today and the left effusion has nearly resolved with mild residual left basal atelectasis noted. There is persistent opacity in the right upper and lower lungs which remain concerning for pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged. Bony structures are intact.
