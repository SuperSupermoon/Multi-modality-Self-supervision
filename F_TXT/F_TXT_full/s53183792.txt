The new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Compared with the prior radiograph, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with continued minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The known left-sided chest wall mass with destruction of the left sixth anterior rib is better assessed on the recent chest CT. Incidental note again made of spinal fixation hardware and evidence of prior spinal artery embolization.
