1. A nasogastric tube is seen with the tip coursing below the diaphragm and obscured by some contrast, which is seen within the stomach. Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the proximal SVC. An endotracheal tube is identified with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity which likely reflects a combination of layering effusion with compressive atelectasis, although a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. There is persistent but improving interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated on this semi-erect study. Calcification of the aorta is consistent with atherosclerosis. Heart remains stably enlarged.
