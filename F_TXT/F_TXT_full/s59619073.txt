There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube whose tip sits ___ cm above the carina. Endogastric tube courses inferiorly with its side port well below the GE junction. A right-sided PICC tip terminates at the lower SVC. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Diffuse airspace opacities are present, as well as an underlying interstitial process; these opcacities are subtly increased in the left upper lung. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
