The left subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Lung volumes are lower with diffuse airspace process and a more focal area of consolidation in the retrocardiac region which may represent a component of partial lower lobe atelectasis. No large effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax. Lucency projecting over the lower cardiac silhouette may reflect aeration in spared segment of left lower lobe versus air within a distended esophagus. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. A wet reading was provided to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at 9:___ p.m.
