There has been interval placement of a right bronchial stent. The known large right perihilar mass is somewhat obscured by new opacifications in right mid-lung, possibly postsurgical in nature, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. The lung volumes are low with increased mild bibasilar atelectasis. The heart is top-normal to mildly enlarged in size. No pneumothorax.
