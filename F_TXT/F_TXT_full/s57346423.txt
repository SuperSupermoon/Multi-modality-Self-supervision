The patient is somewhat rotated on today's study. Lung volumes are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits. The previously demonstrated patchy retrocardiac opacities are not as clearly seen today. No consolidation, pneumothorax in. Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
