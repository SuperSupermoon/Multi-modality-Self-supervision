PA and lateral chest compared to ___ at 11:03 a.m.: New feeding tube, without a wire stylet, ends in the mid esophagus just below the level of the carina. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is probably increased in volume, but comparison is difficult because patient is supine on this study, erect on the earlier study today. Consolidation at both lung bases is probably due to worsening atelectasis but of course pneumonia and large scale aspiration are not excluded. Patient is rotated to her left which distorts the cardiac silhouette, probably mildly enlarged but unchanged. The left rib fractures are in various stages of healing. Thoracic aorta is tortuous and heavily calcified. No pneumothorax. Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.
