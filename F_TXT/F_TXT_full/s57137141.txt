The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5-6 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses at least as far as the left hemidiaphragm, but its distal course is not otherwise visualized more inferiorly. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The heart is normal in size. There is a small pleural effusion on the right and possibly one on the left, although the left costophrenic sulcus is not completely imaged. Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region slightly obscuring the left hemidiaphragm suggests minor atelectasis. Hazy opacification of each lung is somewhat asymmetric, more extensive on the right than left, but probably due to fluid overload. Lower right lateral ribs show considerable overlap and are difficult to assess. On the left, there is an angular appearance to the anterolateral margin of the left sixth rib, suggesting a non-displaced fracture.
