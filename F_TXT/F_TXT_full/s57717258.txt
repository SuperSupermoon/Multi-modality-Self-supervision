Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Streaky opacities are seen within both lower lung fields, likely atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly demonstrated. Numerous bilateral remote rib fractures are again seen as well as deformity of the left proximal humerus.
