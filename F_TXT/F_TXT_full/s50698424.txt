Minimal improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema compared to the study from yesterday. The lungs are otherwise clear. There continues to be stable widening of the upper mediastinum reflecting elevated central venous pressure. The heart size is normal. A small left pleural effusion persists and there is a new small right-sided pleural effusion as demonstrated by uniform right lower lung field opacity which obscures the hemidiaphragmatic contour. A right IJ central line terminates appropriately in the low SVC. The endotracheal tube has been withdrawn and now lies appropriately 3.7 cm above the carina. The orogastric tube is unchanged in position, with the side port in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax.
