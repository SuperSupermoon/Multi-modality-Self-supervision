AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Thoracocentesis of the right side has been performed during the examination interval. The amount of pleural effusion has diminished; however, substantial amount remains and still obscures the right-sided diaphragm and the lateral pleural sinus. The previously identified two pleural drainage tubes remain in location. It is unclear whether they are located in the abdomen or the pleural space. Persistent density in the lower thoracic area is consistent with the previously on CT identified collapse of both right lower lobe and middle lobe. No significant pneumothorax is seen in the apical area. The left hemithorax remains unchanged and within normal limits.
