In comparison with the study of ___, the increased opacification in the right upper zone has substantially cleared. This could reflect previous aspiration or possibly even re-expansion of a collapsed upper lobe. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Opacification along the right lateral chest wall and hazy opacification at the bases consistent with pleural effusion on this side. Mild opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe. No convincing evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
