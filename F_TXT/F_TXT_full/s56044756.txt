Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There is a selective intubation of the left main bronchus. This is unchanged from prior study. Bibasilar consolidations, larger in the left side, and faint opacities in the right upper lobe are grossly unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Differential diagnosis of these opacities is broad, includes multifocal pneumonia, hemorrhage, or atypical infection. Given the short interval , malignant process cannot be excluded and continued followup is recommended. On CT from ___, these opacities are better depicted as well as bronchiectasis and loss of volume in the lingula and right middle lobe.
