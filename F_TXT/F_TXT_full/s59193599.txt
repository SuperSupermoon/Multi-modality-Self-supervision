Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates persistent though minimally improved mild to moderate pulmonary edema with slightly improved aeration of the bilateral upper lungs, left greater than right. Bibasilar opacifications noted, likely combination of atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions, though concurrent infectious process cannot be appreciated. Endotracheal tube ends 2.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing into stomach and out of view.
