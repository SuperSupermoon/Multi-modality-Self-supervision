The large right loculated pleural effusion is unchanged from yesterday. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a small left pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged. There is worsening of moderate pulmonary edema. Evidence of prior sternotomy and coronary pericardial stripping is unchanged.
