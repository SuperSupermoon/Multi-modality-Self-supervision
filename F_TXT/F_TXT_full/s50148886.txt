Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, however aspiration or pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There is a probable small left pleural effusion. The mediastinum appears somewhat wide, which may relate to portable supine technique. There is no pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube ends 3.7 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, which appears distended with gas. Right subclavian central venous line ends in the upper right atrium.
