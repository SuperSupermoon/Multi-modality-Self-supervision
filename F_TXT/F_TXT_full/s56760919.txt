Right internal jugular large bore catheter and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. Tracheostomy tube is in satisfactory position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. The diffuse bilateral airspace process is stable and could represent pulmonary edema or a diffuse infectious process. Clinical correlation is recommended. There are several calcified mediastinal lymph nodes suggestive of prior granulomatous infection. No obvious pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
