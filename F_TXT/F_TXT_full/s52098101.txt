AP chest at 2:33 compared to ___ an: Lung volumes remain quite low with discrete atelectasis in both the right upper and lower lungs. New consolidative opacities at the base of the left lung could be either atelectasis or pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Tip of the ET tube, with the chin either elevated or in neutral position, is less than 2 cm above the carina, should be withdrawn 2 cm for optimal positioning. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads following their expected courses and a remnant right-sided lead still ends in the right ventricle. Dual channel left supraclavicular central venous catheter set ends close to the origin of the SVC, as before.
