CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. There is cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve. Compared with ___ at 12:45 p.m., no gross change is detected. Again seen is CHF, with left greater than right pleural effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The left effusion may be slightly larger, but also appears different due to differences in positioning. Deformity of the left humeral head suggests articular surface collapse and could reflect slight changes of osteonecrosis.
