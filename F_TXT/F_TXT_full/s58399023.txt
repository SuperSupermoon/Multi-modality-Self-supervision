An NG tube is present, tip curled in the gastric fundus. A right subclavian PICC line tip overlies the SVC/RA junction, more distal than on the prior film. No pneumothorax detected . There are low inspiratory volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly prominent, but unchanged and likely accentuated by low lung volumes. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior study. There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. Right hemidiaphragm is elevated, but unchanged. No gross effusions.
