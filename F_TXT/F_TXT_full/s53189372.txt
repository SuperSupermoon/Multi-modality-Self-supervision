AP chest compared to ___: Appearance of the chest has not changed very much since ___. Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung is probably not pneumonia or atelectasis. Left lower lobe is densely consolidated and abnormality in the lingula, probably atelectasis, obscures left heart border. The heart is mildly to moderately enlarged, but remains shifted into the left hemithorax, presumably because of atelectasis. No appreciable pneumothorax. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is probably still present. Lines and tubes are unchanged in their respective positions.
