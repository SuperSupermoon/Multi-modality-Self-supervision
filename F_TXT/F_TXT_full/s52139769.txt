As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change, except for the fact that the patient has received a ventricular decompression device and a new nasogastric tube. The nasogastric tube projects with its tip over the middle parts of the stomach. The uppermost sternal wire is, in unchanged manner, ruptured. Moderate cardiomegaly. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
