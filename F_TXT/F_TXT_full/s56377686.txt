Compared with the immediate prior study, endotracheal and enteric tubes have been removed and a tracheostomy has been placed, which ends 4.5 cm from the carina. The left-sided PICC line ends in the upper SVC. The moderate left pleural effusion appears to have decreased, now small, though this may be due to changes in positioning. The left perihilar opacity may have improved slightly as well. Right base consolidation continues to improve. Heart size is top normal and unchanged. Spinal fusion hardware projects in unchanged position.
