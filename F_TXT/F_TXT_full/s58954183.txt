ET tube terminates 4.5 cm above the carina. Esophageal stent is intact. Sternotomy wires are intact. Mediastinal surgical clips are again noted. There is pneumoperitoneum, which is probably explained by recent J-tube placement. There is increased opacity in the left lung, which could be due to increased pulmonary edema. Right lower lobe opacity is probably due to atelectasis and appears similar to 4hr prior. Bilateral pleural effusions are small, larger on the right. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is borderline enlarged.
