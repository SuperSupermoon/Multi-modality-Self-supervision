A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low SVC, as before. A pleural catheter continues to end at the left lung base, although the distal end of the catheter has lost its previously seen pigtail configuration. Lung volumes remain slightly low. Dense left retrocardiac atelectasis is not significantly changed. Scattered heterogeneous opacities throughout the remainder of the left lung are subsegmental atelectasis, possibly related to splinting in the setting of multiple unchanged left-sided rib fractures. There is no definite pneumothorax. A small left pleural effusion is not significantly changed. There are increased right lower lung heterogeneous opacities, likely asymmetric pulmonary edema versus early pneumonia. The heart size is mildly enlarged, increased compared to the prior study from ___. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. The stomach is mildly distended with air.
