Lung volumes are low. Assessment of the left apex is obscured by the patient's neck projecting over this area. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with a left ventricular predominance is again noted. Aortic knob calcifications are present. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are re- demonstrated. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is seen in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
