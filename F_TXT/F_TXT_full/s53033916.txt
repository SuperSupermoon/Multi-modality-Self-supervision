On the background of severe cardiomegaly, there are bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities, more pronounced in the mid and low lung fields with bilateral hilar engorgement. An area of more focal patchy/alveolar consolidation is seen in the right lower lobe. There might be a small right-sided pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires and surgical clips are redemonstrated. No subdiaphragmatic free air is seen.
