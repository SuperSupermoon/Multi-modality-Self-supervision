Single chest AP radiograph demonstrates a calcified, tortuous aorta. Otherwise, the mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours are unremarkable. A very faint opacity in the left lower lung likely represents atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting cannot exclude early pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.
