As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of massive bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that might have slightly increased in severity since the previous examination. The right pigtail catheter has been removed. There is a small remnant basal pleural effusion and a relatively large intrafissural capsulated pleural effusion, both on the right. The ventilation of the right lung bases, however, is improved as compared to the previous image. Unchanged left lung. The drain is seen in the left lateral soft tissues.
