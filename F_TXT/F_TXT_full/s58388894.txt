Three right chest tubes remain in place and there is a small right apical and lateral pneumothorax which may be slightly larger when compared to the most recent prior study, although this could be related to differences in positioning. Followup imaging should be considered. Left subclavian PICC line is unchanged. Heart remains stably enlarged. There is residual but improving mild interstitial and perihilar edema. Layering effusion on the left with associated retrocardiac opacity is stable consistent with partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
