The right approach PICC has been repositioned, now terminating in the low SVC. Low lung volumes cause left basilar atelectasis. A small to moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged from the prior study. There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates within the stomach. The endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm from the carina. The previously seen right subclavian line has been removed.
