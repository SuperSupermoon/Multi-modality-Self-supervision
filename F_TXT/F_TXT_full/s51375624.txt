Left-sided chest tube remains in place, with moderate left pleural effusion, unchanged in size and persistently partially loculated. Heterogeneous lung opacities in the left mid and lower lung regions are again demonstrated, and may represent atelectasis or infectious consolidation. Right lung is clear except for linear atelectasis at the right base.
