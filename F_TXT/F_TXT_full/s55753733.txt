Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. It appears that the endotracheal tube has been removed. Hardware is seen overlying the lower cervical and lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine. Interval appearance of a linear opacity at the left base likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis. There is decreased but persistent mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. Probable small layering effusions, right greater than left.
