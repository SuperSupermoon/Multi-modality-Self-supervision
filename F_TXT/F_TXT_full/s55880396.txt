There are persistent small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly smaller on the left. Left lower lobe atelectasis is also unchanged. A left-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. Prominence of the bilateral hila likely reflect pulmonary vascular congestion. Surgical clips project over the left hemi thorax.
