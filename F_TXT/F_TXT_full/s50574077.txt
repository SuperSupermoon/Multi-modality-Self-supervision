As compared to the previous examination, there is a massive progression. Known mediastinal ___ and known left-sided bronchial stent. However, the stent appears to be partially occluded, causing atelectasis and very widespread parenchymal opacities in the entire ventilated left lung. At the level of the left apex, an upper lobe atelectasis appears to have occurred. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm cannot be excluded. Extensive perihilar consolidation. Minimal progression of pre-existing subtle right basal peribronchial opacities, documented on the CT examination from the ___.
