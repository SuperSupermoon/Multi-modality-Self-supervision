A portable upright chest radiograph shows newly placed Dobbhoff tube with the radiodense tip beyond the gastroesophageal junction, but still at the expected level of the proximal stomach. The tip of the right internal jugular pheresis line is at the level of the distal superior vena cava. The left hemidiaphragm remains elevated and slightly obscured. Radiodense material is seen in the hepatic flexure. Note, exclusion of the apices and upper mediastinum from the view of the film.
