The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent but stable. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged with prior coronary stenting noted. Calcification at the aortic knob is unchanged. A large bore left-sided central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the right atrium. The pulmonary vasculature is prominent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly improved from ___. There is increased right perihilar opacification from the most recent prior study also likely due to pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities at the bilateral lung bases most likely reflect atelectasis; however, superimposed infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical context. There is a small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Radiopaque densities projecting over the left lateral lung base are likely external to the patient. There is no evidence of free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
