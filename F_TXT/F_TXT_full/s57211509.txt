As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pigtail catheter is in unchanged position. The right pleural effusion has re-occurred, causing homogeneous opacity at the right lung base. The size of the cardiac silhouette and the retrocardiac atelectasis as well as the pre-existing small left pleural effusion are without relevant change. No pneumothorax.
