There is moderate new bilateral central opacification suggesting new onset of pulmonary edema over the short interval. Pleural effusions are not well demonstrated on this study but are likely to persist as subpulmonic effusions. Developing pneumonia, particularly at the medial right lung base, is not excluded, although findings can likely be explain by pulmonary edema.
