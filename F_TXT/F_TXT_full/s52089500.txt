Lung volumes remain low with bilateral layering effusions and patchy opacities suggestive of atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is advised. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to assess given patient rotation and low lung volumes.
