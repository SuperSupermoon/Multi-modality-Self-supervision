Right chest tubes remain in position. An epidural catheter is unchanged. The right apical pneumothorax is minimally bigger since yesterday with no evidence of tension. Interstitial opacities worse on the right than the left, likely asymmetric pulmonary edema not significantly changed from yesterday. Bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis or consolidation. No change in subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall.
