Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with single lead terminating in the right ventricle, unchanged. Massive cardiomegaly is similar compared to the prior exam. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Mediastinal contours are widened superiorly, unchanged, likely due to combination of mediastinal fat and vessels. There is new mild interstitial pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally likely reflect the presence of trace bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. Rightward deviation of the superior trachea at the thoracic inlet is unchanged, likely due to a combination of mediastinal fat and tortuous vessels. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
