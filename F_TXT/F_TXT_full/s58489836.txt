The lungs are moderately well inflated with subtle veil like opacity along bilateral lower hemithoraces, right greater than left, suggestive of small pleural effusions. Mild cephalization of vasculature with bilateral ground-glass opacities are again noted. There is persistent moderate cardiomegaly which is unchanged in appearance since scout images from prior CT scan. Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
