The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3.5 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular introducer catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Endovascular aortic valve prosthesis is noted. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is probably a small pleural effusion with atelectasis on the left. Small right-sided pleural effusion is no longer conspicuous. Although a right upper lobe opacity is substantially less than distinct than before, there is moderate, somewhat increased diffuse predominantly central opacification suggesting worsening pulmonary edema. The bones appear demineralized with multiple incompletely characterized compression deformities since sites of prior vertebroplasty.
