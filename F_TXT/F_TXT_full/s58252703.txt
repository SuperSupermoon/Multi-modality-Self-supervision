As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing relatively severe parenchymal opacities are slightly increasing in density, showing a tendency to consolidate, notably at the right lung base. A similar, but less extensive progression is seen at the left lung base. There is a small left pleural effusion. The perihilar components of the opacities are unchanged. Unchanged position of the monitoring and support devices. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, so that a new right effusion cannot be excluded.
