The cardiac silhouette is mildly more prominent compared to the most recent prior examination. Background chronic pulmonary changes are noted. Opacification at bilateral lung bases appears slightly more prominent on today's study but this may actually reflect overlying soft tissues versus mild edema, atelectasis or infectious process. Recommend a true PA and lateral for further evaluation, particularly if clinical symptoms persist.
