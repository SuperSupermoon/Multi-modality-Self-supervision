There is a new moderate sized left pleural effusion with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and left heart border, likely representing underlying atelectasis or consolidation. The right lung is relatively clear without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia or pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is present. The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct suggesting mild vascular congestion, increased in comparison to the most recent prior chest radiograph. Hazy opacification of the right lung suggests mild edema. The trachea is deviated to the left and narrowed, corresponding to the patient's known multinodular thyroid goiter. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated but likely remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are prominent with a widened and tortuous thoracic aorta, unchanged from the prior chest radiograph with calcification of the aortic arch.
