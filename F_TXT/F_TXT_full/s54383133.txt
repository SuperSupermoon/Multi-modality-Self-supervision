AP portable supine view of the chest. Limited exam due to motion artifact and low lung volumes. Mildly elevated right hemidiaphragm noted. Allowing for study limitations, there is no convincing evidence for pneumonia or overt edema. No layering effusion or supine evidence for pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Bony structures are intact.
