Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum, mild pulmonary edema, and small bilateral pleural effusions with associated bilateral atelectasis are unchanged. NG tube tip is not clearly visualized. ET tube is in standard position.
