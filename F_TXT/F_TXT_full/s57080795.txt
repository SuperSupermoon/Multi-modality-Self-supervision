Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC. Large right pleural effusion which is loculated appears slightly increased compared to the prior study. Right basilar opacification could reflect compressive atelectasis though infection is not excluded. Chest tube is again noted with tip projecting over the right lung base. There is mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures, slightly increased compared to the prior study. Cardiac and mediastinal contours otherwise are unchanged. Streaky left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified, and no pulmonary edema is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
