Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Cardiomegaly is prominent in particular involving left ventricle. Right atrium is enlarged as well given the wide angle of the carina. Diffuse interstitial opacities are noted bilaterally and might be consistent with fluid overload. Interstitial lung disease would be another possibility, but comparison to prior studies is required. No focal consolidations to suggest infectious process is currently demonstrated. No large amount of fluid is seen but small amount cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax demonstrated.
