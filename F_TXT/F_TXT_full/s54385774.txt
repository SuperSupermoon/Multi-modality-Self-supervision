There has been interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter. A right-sided internal jugular catheter is in-situ, the tip terminates in the distal SVC. A nasoenteric tube is in-situ, the side port is at approximately the level the gastroesophageal junction and this could be advanced further into the stomach. There are persistent bilateral airspace opacities in a predominately perihilar distribution consistent with pulmonary edema. There is silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged compared to the prior study. This may reflect atelectasis or consolidation. Similar appearance in the left lower lobe. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Stable cardiomegaly.
