Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. Lung volumes are low which limits evaluation. Allowing for this there is no definite sign of pneumonia or CHF. Please note the retrocardiac region is poorly assessed. No large effusion or pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinal contour appear within normal limits. Bony structures are intact.
