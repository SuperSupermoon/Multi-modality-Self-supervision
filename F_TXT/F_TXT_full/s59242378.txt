Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating at the cavoatrial junction, without evidence of pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube is somewhat high in position, measuring approximately 9.5 cm above the level of the carina; suggest advancing by approximately 3 cm. Bilateral opacities are overall grossly stable with possible slight increase at the left perihilar and medial lung bases. Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen, possibly slightly increased. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. No pneumothorax seen.
