A right approach PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. Severe consolidation of the entire right lung appears similar to most recent prior examination and is likely a combination of pneumonia and pleural fluid. Interstitial edema within the left lung remains moderate. A small left pleural effusion is likely. Additional left basilar opacities may reflect additional foci of infection. Apical thickening bilaterally is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain mildly enlarged.
