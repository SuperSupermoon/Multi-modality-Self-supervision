The lungs are well expanded and clear. Heart size is normal. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema. Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are unremarkable, noting a tortuous ascending aorta. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. An enteric passes below the GE junction and terminates in the gastric body. However, the side port likely terminates above the GE junction.
