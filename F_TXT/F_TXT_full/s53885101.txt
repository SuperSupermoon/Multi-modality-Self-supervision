The lung volumes have diminished and there is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which presumably is chronic. Interval appearance of patchy opacity in the right mid and lower lung which could reflect an area of aspiration or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to marked patient rotation. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Incompletely visualized spinal hardware overlying the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. Clips in the right upper quadrant consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
