Only a small amount of fluid has collected in the left pneumonectomy space since ___:54 on ___, possibly draining instead through the indwelling left thoracostomy. The soft tissue along the left chest wall could be loculated fluid in the pneumonectomy space and/or tissue augmentation to heal the left thoracoplasty. Right lung is grossly clear below the level of the severely retracted hilus due to scarring in the right upper lobe. Heart size is normal. Because of severe leftward mediastinal displacement the course of the intended insert notified right internal jugular introducer does not necessarily indicate errant placement; clinical assessment of line placement is recommended.
