Compared to the prior film, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. It replaced with a sheath that overlies the proximal/mid SVC. Again seen is a right subclavian PICC line. The PICC line is now visible in the mediastinum. The tip overlies the upper right atrium. This could be retracted by approximately 3 cm to lie in the distal SVC near the SVC/RA junction. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. No pneumothorax is detected.
