Right subclavian artery stent is again seen. Unchanged calcific densities projecting over the apices bilaterally could represent vascular calcification. Normal heart size. Normal mediastinal and hilar contours. New retrocardiac opacity and decreased left lung volume is consistent with left basilar atelectasis. Linear opacities at the left base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. Right lung is clear. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pneumonia.
