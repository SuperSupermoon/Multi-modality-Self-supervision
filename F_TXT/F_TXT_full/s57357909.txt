Lung volumes are markedly low. Endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating approximately 4 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip and side port are within the stomach. A right internal jugular central venous catheter tip lies within the right atrium similar to that seen the previous study. Heart size is accentuated due to low lung volumes, appearing mildly enlarged. Similarly, the superior mediastinum appears widened due to supine AP positioning and low lung volumes. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect atelectasis, however aspiration cannot be excluded. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
