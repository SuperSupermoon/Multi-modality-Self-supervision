As compared to the previous image, the patient has received a right pleural pigtail catheter. The position of the catheter appears correct. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in extent but still occupies a substantial part of the right hemithorax. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the left lung. No pulmonary edema. Non-characteristic atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions.
