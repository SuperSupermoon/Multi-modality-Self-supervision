The right large bore dual lumen internal jugular catheter is unchanged in position and does not demonstrate any kinks. A left internal jugular central line terminates in the proximal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
