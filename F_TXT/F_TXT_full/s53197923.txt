As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received vertebral stabilization devices in the cervical region. A large hiatal hernia is still visible. The lung volumes are low but there is no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. Partly ruptured sternal wires after CABG. The size of the cardiac silhouette, and in particular the left ventricle are slightly enlarged.
