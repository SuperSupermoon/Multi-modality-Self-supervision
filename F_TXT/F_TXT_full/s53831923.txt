Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for the purpose of nasogastric tube placement assessment, demonstrating a nasogastric tube terminating within the proximal stomach. Dilated loops of bowel in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen are incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph. Note is again made of free intraperitoneal air, likely related to recent surgery.
