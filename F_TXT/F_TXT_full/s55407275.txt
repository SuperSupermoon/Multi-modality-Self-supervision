Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral opacities, largely unchanged since the most recent examination. An ET tube has been placed in the interval, and terminates approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. A transesophageal tube is also identified, the tip of which is still seen in the thorax.
