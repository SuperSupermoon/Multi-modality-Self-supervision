AP chest compared to ___: Moderate to large right pleural effusion has increased substantially. On the left there is a small apical pneumothorax but no appreciable pleural effusion since removal of the left pleural drain. Left subclavian line ends in the SVC. A bulging mediastinal contour that is superior and lateral to the curve of the central venous line is probably paraspinal, presumably hematoma, or otherwise related to the right pleural effusion. Left lower lobe atelectasis is worsened. Heart size is normal. Dr. ___ and I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.
