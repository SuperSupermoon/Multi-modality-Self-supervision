A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a dual lead pacemaker with the leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette may be due to magnification related to the patient's body habitus. Surgical material along the mediastinum is unchanged. Opacity along the right hemidiaphragm may be a combination of atelectasis and post-biopsy bleeding. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
