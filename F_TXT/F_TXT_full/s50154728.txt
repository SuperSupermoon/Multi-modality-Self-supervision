As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing parenchymal opacities. Predominating at the lung base on the right have progressed. A milder progression is seen with regard to the left retrocardiac opacities. The slight asymmetry of the changes as well as the absence of other signs indicative of pulmonary edema suggest the presence of pneumonia. The presence of a minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
