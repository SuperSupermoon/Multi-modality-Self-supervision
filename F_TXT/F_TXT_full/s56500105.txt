There are low inspiratory volumes. The patient is status post sternotomy, with multiple surgical clips. Mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is minimal patchy opacity at the left base, which is similar to the earlier film and may represent atelectasis and/or and postoperative changes. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle noted. No gross effusion. There is upper zone redistribution with mild vascular blurring, also similar to the prior film, allowing for technique. Right hemidiaphragm is again noted to be elevated.
