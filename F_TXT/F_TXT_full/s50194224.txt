In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly better lung volumes. There is increased opacification in the left hilar and suprahilar region which, in view of the clinical history, could well represent developing consolidation. Atelectatic streaks are seen in the retrocardiac region. Continued mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without appreciable vascular congestion. There are surgical clips in the perihilar regions bilaterally, for an uncertain reason. If these clips are related to previous malignancy, CT would be suggested for further evaluation. If the clinical symptoms are consistent with pneumonia and there is no history of malignancy, appropriate treatment could be performed to assess for clearing.
