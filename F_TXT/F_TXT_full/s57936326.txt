In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. The left hemidiaphragm is again poorly seen, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe with probable effusion. This latter observation is supported by haziness of the left hemithorax, consistent with layering fluid. The right lung is essentially clear. Overall, cardiac size remains enlarged. Poor definition of pulmonary vessels is consistent with increased pulmonary venous pressure.
