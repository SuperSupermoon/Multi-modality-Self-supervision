Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube with tip obscured from view but well below diaphragm. Of note, the DHT appears to still have wire in place. In addition, there is likely coiling of the tube in the pharynx. After confirming with team placing Dobbhoff, the tube was fixed to the patient's cheek at the time of x-ray and thus not draped across the neck. There is stable left PICC line with tip in the mid SVC. Otherwise, there is a minimal improvement of the pulmonary edema with a stable small left pleural effusion. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly present. Normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
