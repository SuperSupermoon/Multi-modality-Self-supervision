No consolidation or pulmonary edema is seen. Continued elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged, consistent with previous left lower lobectomy. Opacities at the left base are likely secondary to scarring. Stable calcifications of the aortic knob continue to be seen, and post-thoracotomy bony changes are seen. The left 6th rib is not seen posteriorly.
