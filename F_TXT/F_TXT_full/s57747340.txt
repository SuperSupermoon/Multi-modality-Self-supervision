Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina. The right central venous line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal consolidations are unchanged with potentially slight increase in the right pleural effusion, although it may be related to re-distribution of fluid due to patient more of right side leaning position. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, except for potential re-distribution or increase in the right pleural effusion, no changes have been demonstrated.
