Dobhoff type tube with radiopaque tip overlying the gastric fundus. Left subclavian central line with tip over mid/distal SVC. There are low inspiratory volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Mild vascular plethora is suggested, similar to the prior film. However, this appearance is likely accentuated due to low inspiratory volumes. Minimal patchy opacity at both lung bases again noted, similar to the prior film. No frank consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax detected.
