Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on ___, at 5:32 p.m. The left chest tubes are in place. There is left chest wall air, unchanged. There is increased lucency projecting over the left upper abdomen that might reflect distended stomach, but pneumoperitoneum is a possibility and correlation with dedicated abdominal imaging is recommended. The rest of the findings are stable.
