Heart size is normal. The aorta remains tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Hilar contours remain prominent and may reflect underlying lymphadenopathy. Increased opacities are seen in the left mid lung field, right perihilar region, and left lung base. Previously noted nodules seen on prior CT are not well assessed on current radiograph. Increased interstitial opacities in the right lung base with associated punctate calcifications may be due to sequela of previous aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is noted within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
