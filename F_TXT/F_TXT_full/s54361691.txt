Oblique positioning. The ET tube is partially obscured, but appears to lie approximately 4.0 cm above the carina. An NG-type tube is present, also poorly delineated due to underpenetration. On the edge-enhanced image, the NGT tip appears to extend beneath the diaphragm, off the film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged. The right hilum is enlarged, with a lumpy bumpy appearance, raising the question of lymphadenopathy This is unchanged compared with the ___ CXR. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, asymmetrically more prominent on the right. Some focal patchy opacity at the right greater than left bases is noted. While this could represent atelectasis/CHF, the possibility of pneumonic infiltrates cannot be excluded. No gross effusion.
