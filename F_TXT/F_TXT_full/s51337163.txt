Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated, and the mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, new in the interval. Persistent hazy opacity within the right lung base is concerning for pneumonia with adjacent moderate size right pleural effusion. Worsening opacification in the retrocardiac region may reflect worsening atelectasis or an additional area of infection, with a small left pleural effusion also noted. No pneumothorax is identified.
