Comparison is made with prior study ___. Mild-to-moderate vascular congestion has worsened. Size of the cardiac silhouette cannot be assessed, is obscured by pleuroparenchymal abnormalities. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. NG tube tip is in unchanged position, projects in the left lower hemithorax, probably in the stomach. Drains project in the left lower hemithorax. Widened mediastinum has increased due to worsening vascular engorgement. Assessment of pleural effusion is limited, but no large effusions are noted. There is no evident pneumothorax.
