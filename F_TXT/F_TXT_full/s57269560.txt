Platelike atelectasis is noted bilaterally. Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Gaseous distention of the bowel in the left upper quadrant has increased slightly compared with the prior study. Apparent inferior subluxation of the left humeral head appears stable from the most recent prior study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
