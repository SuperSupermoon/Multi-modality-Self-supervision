The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, reflective of mild cardiomegaly. Lung volumes are slightly low. The hila are unremarkable. Opacity at the medial right lung base is unchanged and likely reflects atelectasis. Also re- demonstrated is opacity at the left lung base appearing to involve the lingula, likely reflecting atelectasis. There is no new superimposed focal lung consolidation. There is no pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusion. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is partially imaged.
