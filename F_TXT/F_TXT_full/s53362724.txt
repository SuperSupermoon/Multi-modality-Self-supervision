Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation. Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular structures. There is probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, with possible trace bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is detected. No acute osseous abnormality is present. Remote fracture of multiple left sided ribs and the left mid clavicle are re- demonstrated.
