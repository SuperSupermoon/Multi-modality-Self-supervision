In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 4 hours prior, no significant changes are appreciated. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Heart size top-normal. Pleural effusion small, if any. Extensive pleural calcifications somewhat limiting evaluation for pneumonia, though no focal consolidations are identified.
