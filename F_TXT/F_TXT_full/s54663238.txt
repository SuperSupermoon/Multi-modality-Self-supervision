In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with pleural fluid and underlying compressive atelectasis bilaterally. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure in this patient with a single pacer lead extends to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.
