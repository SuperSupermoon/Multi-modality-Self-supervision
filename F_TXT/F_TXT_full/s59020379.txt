Large lung volumes are due to small airway obstruction either asthma or emphysema. Heterogeneous opacification is progressing both Lung bases, probably aspiration pneumonia. Heart is top-normal size given the extent of hyperinflation, and pulmonary vasculature to the upper lobes is mildly engorged, but I see little if any pulmonary edema and no evidence of pleural effusion. Tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 3 cm from the carina with the chin extended. It should be withdrawn ___-20 mm to ovoid unilateral intubation when the chin is flexed. Esophageal tube is redundant in the stomach. Right jugular line ends at the origin of the right brachiocephalic vein.
