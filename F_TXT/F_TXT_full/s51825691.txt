Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is continued improved aeration of the lungs; however, there is persistent, slight increased elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Left mid lung atelectasis/scarring is noted. No definite new focal consolidation is seen. There is a stable blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
