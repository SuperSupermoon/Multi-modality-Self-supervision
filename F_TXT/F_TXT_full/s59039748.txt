Pulmonary vasculature is now more engorged but there is not as yet pulmonary edema. Lower lungs are partially obscured by pleural calcification, but there does appear to be developing right lower lobe consolidation, most commonly due to aspiration. Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged. No pneumothorax.
