Volume loss in the right hemithorax again reflects prior lobectomy. New right apical chest tube is in unchanged position. There is stable amount of pleural fluid and right apical pneumothorax on the right. Multifocal opacities in the right base and right perihilar region may reflect atelectasis. With the exception of small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, the left lung remains clear. Mediastinal contours are unchanged, again shifted to the right, reflecting volume loss. No new opacity to suggest pneumonia.
