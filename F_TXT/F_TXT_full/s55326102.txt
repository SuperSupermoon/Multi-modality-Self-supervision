As compared to the previous radiograph, there is mild progression of the preexisting and already very severe parenchymal opacities. Opacities are relatively diffuse and bilateral. No evidence of pleural effusions is noted, despite the gravity of the parenchymal changes. The lung volumes remain low. Moderate cardiomegaly. The patient has been extubated, nasogastric tube has been removed.
