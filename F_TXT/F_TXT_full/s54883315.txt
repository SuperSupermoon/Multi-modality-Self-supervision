AP chest compared to ___: Greater opacification has developed at both lung bases, presumably atelectasis, but raising concern for aspiration. Accompanying the lung findings are small pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Previous severe subcutaneous emphysema traceable to surgery has nearly resolved. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pneumomediastinum. The heart is probably enlarged.
