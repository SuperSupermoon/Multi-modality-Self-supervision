The right-sided central venous catheter tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal contours demonstrate a tortuous aorta with calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob. There is no mediastinal widening. The lung volumes are low, exaggerating the pulmonary vascular congestion, but there is no airspace consolidation or evidence of failure. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
