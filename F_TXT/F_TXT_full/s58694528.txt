Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. Dense retrocardiac opacity is seen, correlate with history of hiatal hernia. Left mid-to-lower lung opacity is seen, which could be due to infection, aspiration or less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema. There is also subtle right upper lobe opacity which could also be due to underlying infection or aspiration. No large pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is top normal or mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified.
