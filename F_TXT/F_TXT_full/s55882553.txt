Severe rotary dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is demonstrated. Large left and moderate-to-large right pleural effusions appear slightly increased in size compared to the prior study. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size is limited due to the presence of the bilateral pleural effusions. There is marked calcification of the thoracic aorta. Hazy perihilar opacities with engorgement of the pulmonary vascularity suggests mild pulmonary edema. There is bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. Known free air within the abdomen seen on the recent CT at 15:41 performed the same day is not clearly noted on the current exam. Excreted contrast material is noted within the left collecting system. Evaluation for rib fractures is limited, though no markedly displaced rib fractures are present.
