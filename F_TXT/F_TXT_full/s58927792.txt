Two chest tubes remain in place in the right hemithorax. Small right apical pneumothorax has slightly changed in distribution, but overall size is similar. Improving asymmetrical pattern of interstitial opacities likely reflect improving asymmetrical edema. More confluent opacities in the right mid and lower lung region are also improving. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally, new on the left and improved on the right with persistent intrafissural component.
