As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, the patient has been intubated, with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 2.8 cm above the carinal with the neck in a flexed position. Right internal jugular catheter has been placed, terminating in the mid superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Exam is otherwise similar to the recent study except for apparent slight increase in size of small right pleural effusion.
