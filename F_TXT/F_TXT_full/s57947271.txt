AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Previously described left internal jugular approach wide-bore dialysis catheter remains in unchanged position terminating within the right atrium. Unchanged is also the position of the VP shunt. No pneumothorax has developed. Previously described bilateral basal densities persist and are indicative of pleural effusions, more marked on the right than the left. There is no evidence of new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates in comparison with the previous portable chest examination.
