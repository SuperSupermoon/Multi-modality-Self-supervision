The heart size is top normal with unchanged mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours. There is a large heterogeneous consolidation of the right lower lung with air bronchograms compatible with pneumonia. There also increased reticulonodular opacities in the upper right lung field likely as a component of asymmetric pulmonary edema or multifocal pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion may be present. There is also a small left-sided effusion with subtle opacities at the left lung base which could be atelectasis or a further component of pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
