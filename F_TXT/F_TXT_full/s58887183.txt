Patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable aside from a double contour appearance to the left cardiac border which may indicate the presence of a large left atrium. There is a small pleural effusion on the right and patchy opacification at the right lung base, probably atelectasis. Prominent indistinct pulmonary vasculature and mild interstitial abnormality are suggestive of mild pulmonary edema although without prior studies, it is difficult to assess for chronicity of interstitial changes in the lower lungs.
