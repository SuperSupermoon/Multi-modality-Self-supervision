Upright portable AP view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated to the right. The lung volumes are low. There has been interval increase in right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis and possible partial collapse of the right lower lobe. Left base opacity with likely pleural effusion persists. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured by overlying opacification caused by the pleural effusion and patient rotation. Possible minimal inferior subluxation of the left humeral head may be positional.
