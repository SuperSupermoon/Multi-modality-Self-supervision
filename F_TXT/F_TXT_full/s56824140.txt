AP chest compared to ___ at 10:41 a.m.: Following findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 4:45 p.m.: ET tube ends in the left main bronchus and would need to be withdrawn between 3 and 4 cm for standard positioning. Pneumothorax on the right is at least moderate in volume. The orientation of the right thoracostomy tube suggests it could be fissural which might contribute to tube dysfunction. There is also a left pleural drain and small, if any, left pleural effusion, and no left pneumothorax. Opacification of the base of both lungs could be contusion or atelectasis or even aspiration and will need to be followed. Low lung volumes make it difficult to exclude mild pulmonary edema. Upper enteric drainage tube passes beyond the upper stomach and out of view. Contour of the mediastinum, widened, is equivocal regarding possible mediastinal hematoma. I am told that the patient has had a subsequent chest and abdomen CT which should evaluate this region.
