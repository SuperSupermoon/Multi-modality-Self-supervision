As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the three right-sided chest tubes after decortication are in constant position. The right postoperative lung opacities and the right pleural effusion as well as the post-surgical rib fractures are constant. In the left lung, there is increasing retrocardiac atelectasis and, potentially, a developing small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
