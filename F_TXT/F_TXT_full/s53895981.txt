Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. In the setting of the low lung volumes, there is minimal increase in density of the parenchyma at the left base, with a morphology more consistent with atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
