A right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. An enteric tube has been placed in the interim but the side port is above the GE junction and should be advanced by at least 10 cm to position it within the gastric body. There is mild interstitial edema. Bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right is again noted. Bilateral small pleural effusions are noted. There is no large pneumothorax.
