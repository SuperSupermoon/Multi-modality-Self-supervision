Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. A metallic stent is seen in the right upper quadrant, likely residing within the CBD. Bibasilar opacities are most compatible with atelectasis. No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm. Given the presence of lower lobe atelectasis, the possibility of a superimposed pneumonia is difficult to exclude. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Bony structures appear intact.
