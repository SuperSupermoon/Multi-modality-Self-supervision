Is portable upright AP chest radiograph shows new subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base and right pericardiac region and unchanged linear scar at the left lung base. Although the overall cardiac size remains within normal limits, the left heart border has lost its concavity and there is some mild redistribution of pulmonary blood flow to the upper lobes without haziness or edema. Several small, sub cm, calcified lymph nodes are seen in the right perihilar region and these are new. No pneumothorax is seen status post thermoplasty.
