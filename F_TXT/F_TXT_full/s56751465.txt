A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of an endotracheal tube, with the tip terminating 3.3 cm above the carina. Apparent change in tracheal caliber at the thoracic inlet is seen on multiple prior images. A dual lead left-sided pacer is unchanged in position, with the leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle. A right-sided PICC is retracted compared to prior exam, with the tip now terminating in the mid SVC. Diffuse airspace opacities are redemonstrated, with increased opacity in the right upper lung and a new opacity in the left upper lateral lung. This could represent multifocal pneumonia, or an infectious process superimposed on asymmetric pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, the differential could include other causes of alveolar opacities. There are again probable bilateral layering pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified.
