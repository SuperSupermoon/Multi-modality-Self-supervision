Pneumonia in the right lower lung has increased accompanied by an increase in moderate right pleural effusion, concerning for empyema. Mild pulmonary edema has developed. Small left pleural effusion slightly larger. No pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly has not improved, but since the right heart border is obscured, I cannot tell if the heart is larger.
