A tracheostomy tube is in-situ. A right-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC. A left-sided internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. Lung volumes are low with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. This results in crowding of the pulmonary bronchovascular structures limiting assessment. No definite consolidation seen. No definite pleural effusion seen.
