AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. Multifocal consolidations appear to be slightly more pronounced when the current study is compared to prior imaging consistent with worsening of the infectious process. Mild degree of underlying pulmonary edema is unchanged. Cardiomegaly is unchanged as well as the mediastinal contours. No interval development of pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The patient can potentially develop ARDS in the interim, mimicking multifocal pneumonia, please correlate clinically.
