The patient is leaning to the right and the right sided lung volume is slightly low. There is mild upper zone redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF. There is minimal atelectasis in the right mid and lower zones. Possible trace subsegmental atelectasis the left base. No frank consolidation is identified. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged compared with ___ , allowing for technical differences.
