There has been an interval increase in the moderate to severe parenchymal opacities, predominately at the lung bases bilaterally, and bilateral perihilar region. There has been interval progression of small bilateral pleural effusions. Widening of the upper mediastinum, at the region of the thoracic inlet, is unchanged compared to the prior exam given differences in acquisition technique. Note is made of bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
