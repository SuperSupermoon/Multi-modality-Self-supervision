As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The lung volumes remain low. There is mild fluid overload and moderate retrocardiac atelectasis, combined to moderate cardiomegaly. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, the presence of a small left pleural effusion in this location cannot be excluded. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumonia.
