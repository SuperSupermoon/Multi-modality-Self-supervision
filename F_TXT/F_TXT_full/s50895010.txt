Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there are new hazy opacities in the mid and lower right lung. Extensive parenchymal and pleural changes in the left hemithorax are grossly unchanged with at least a moderate, loculated, left apical pleural effusion and a moderate, dependent, left pleural effusion. The visualized cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
