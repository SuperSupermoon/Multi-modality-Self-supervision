AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is normal. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax within the limitations of the study technique. Bibasal opacities are present and unclear if represent atelectasis or aspiration. Some contribution to this appearance is done by the low lung volumes, although they cannot explain the entire extent of bibasal opacifications. There is no appreciable pleural effusion noted.
