There is a tiny right apical pneumothorax. Right pigtail catheter remains in unchanged position. Right PICC tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Right lower lobe opacities have improved consistent with decreasing in atelectasis and pleural effusion. Cardiomegaly is severe and stable. Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. There are no new lung abnormalities.
