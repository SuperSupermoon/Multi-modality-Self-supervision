An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip is approximately 3 cm above the level the carina. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. A left internal jugular catheter terminates in the distal SVC. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Lung volumes remain low. There are persistent bilateral airspace opacities, more extensive on the right than the left were there is a small pleural effusion tracking along the lateral chest wall. Left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.
