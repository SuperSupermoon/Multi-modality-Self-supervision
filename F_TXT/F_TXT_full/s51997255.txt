There are decreased lung volumes, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. The right hemidiaphragm is noted to be elevated with respect to the left. There is appearant volume loss of the right, medial lung base. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema identified. There appears to be mild cardiomegaly, although this may be exaggerated by the patient's low lung volumes and by the AP projection. Mediastinal contours are normal.
