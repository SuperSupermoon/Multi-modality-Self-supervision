AP chest compared to preoperative chest radiograph on ___ and earlier postoperative chest radiographs ___: There has been little change postoperatively. The volume of persistent pleural space in the left upper hemithorax is small-to-moderate and unchanged. The extent of consolidation in the reexpanded left lung following bullectomy, either hemorrhage or localized edema, is stable. Two left pleural tubes are unchanged in their respective positions and there is no appreciable left pleural effusion. Atelectasis at the base of the right lung is moderately severe and unchanged. This could have significant physiologic effect given the severity of emphysema elsewhere. Heart size is normal.
