A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the upper thoracic trachea. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach, but the side port is proximal to the gastroesophageal junction. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and the lungs are well-aerated and clear. There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. A small left apical pneumothorax appears increased. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable, other than incompletely imaged spinal hardware.
