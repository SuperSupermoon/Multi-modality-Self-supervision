Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance including diffuse tortuosity and calcification of the thoracic aorta. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity is probably a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. There is also a suggestion of a small pleural effusion on the right as well as minimal linear atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Incidental calcified granulomas in the right lung are unchanged.
