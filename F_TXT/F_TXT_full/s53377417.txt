There is persistent left lower lobe collapse with resultant shift of the cardiomediastinal contours to the left. Superimposed infection of the left lower lobe is not excluded. Atelectasis at the right lung base is increased compared to the most recent prior study. The left internal jugular catheter terminates at the brachiocephalic, SVC junction. ETT is in standard position. Enteric tube courses towards the stomach with distal tip not captured on the current study.
