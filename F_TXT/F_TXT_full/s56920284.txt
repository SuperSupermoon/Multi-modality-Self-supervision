Patient is status post median sternotomy. There is grossly stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Loculated right pleural effusion with atelectasis again seen. There is decreased aeration of the right lung as compared to the prior study, which may in part be due to differences in patient position. The left lung is grossly clear.
