The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent prior study. There is increased streaky opacification of the right lung base and blunting of the right costophrenic angle reflecting a combination of small pleural effusion and increased atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacification obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged compatible with small pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis or consolidation. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and edema is slightly improved from the most recent prior study. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable. The mediastinal contours are prominent but unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and calcification of the aortic knob. The trachea is deviated to the right by the aortic knob.
