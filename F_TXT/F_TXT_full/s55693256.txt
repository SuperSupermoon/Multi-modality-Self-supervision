There are low lung volumes. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is at least moderate to severely enlarged. Aortic knob calcifications are re- demonstrated. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild to moderate pulmonary edema present. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
