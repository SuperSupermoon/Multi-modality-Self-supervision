The patient is rotated. Lung volumes are low, overall unchanged. Large right pleural effusion has decreased in size, now moderate. Small left pleural effusion is overall unchanged. Interval decrease in edema, now mild. Bilateral atelectasis is overall unchanged. The heart is mildly enlarged and overall unchanged. No pneumothorax. The trachea is deviated rightward and could be potentially explain by a predominantly larger left goiter a noted on recent CT; however, deviation is slightly more prominent on radiograph compared to prior exams in in the setting of recent left internal jugular vein placement, correlation for possible hematoma is recommended. The left internal jugular vein catheter tip crosses the midline and courses upward in the SVC with the tip now in the upper SVC. The ETT is in standard position. An enteric tube traverses the midline and ends in the right upper quadrant in an air-filled stomach - the side port is probably at the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced. The single-lead cardiac device is unchanged.
