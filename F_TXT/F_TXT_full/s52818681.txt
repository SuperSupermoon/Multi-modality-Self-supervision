The projection precludes meaningful comment on the heart size. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged however. A right-sided internal jugular catheter is in-situ, the tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The tip of a nasogastric tube is outside of the field of view abuts right below the diaphragm. Lung volumes are slightly improved when compared to the prior study. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis is stable compared to the prior study.
