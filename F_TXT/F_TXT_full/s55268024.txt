Right internal jugular catheter terminates in the body of the right atrium with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and is accompanied by slight upper zone vascular re-distribution and minimal peribronchial cuffing. Patchy right lower and left lower lobe opacities are new, and may reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration, infectious pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage in the appropriate clinical settings. Small pleural effusions are also new, left greater than right.
