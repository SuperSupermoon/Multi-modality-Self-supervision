The stent is positioned in the esophagus from the level of the aortic arch to the diaphragm. Despite severe narrowing of both main bronchi due to extensive central adenopathy, I see no bronchial stents. Small right pleural effusion remains, basal pleural pigtail drainage catheter in place. Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis is accompanied by pes small pleural effusion. Heart is normal size. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
