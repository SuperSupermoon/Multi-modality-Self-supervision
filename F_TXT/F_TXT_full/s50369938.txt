Tip of right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the body of the right atrium. Lung volumes are slightly improved compared to the prior study. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for this factor. Improved aeration is present at both lung bases with residual bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis remaining, predominantly in the retrocardiac regions. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also demonstrated, left greater than right.
