Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, two mediastinal drainage catheters, and epicardial pacing wires. The cardiac portion of the mediastinum is moderately larger and a much larger triangular gas and debris collection projecting over the left lower lobe bronchus could be in the stomach, esophagus, mediastinum or pericardium. . The left hemidiaphragm is asymmetrically elevated. There is some left lower lobe atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
