As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The lung volumes remain low, and mild fluid overload is seen. Minimal bilateral pleural effusions. Unchanged mild overinflation of the stomach. Areas of atelectasis at both the right and the left lung bases persist, but the middle and upper parts of the lungs appear slightly better ventilated than on the previous image.
