Since the most recent prior radiograph, the lung volumes are low. There is now increasing opacity at the right lower lung zone most likely due to aspiration. Also seen is increased prominence of pulmonary vasculature likely worsening pulmonary edema. ET tube is 3.3 cm from the carina. NG tube is seen but cannot be followed distal to the diaphragm. There is a right PICC line which is unchanged in position. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
