Single AP portable radiograph is provided. Compared to the prior radiographs, lung volumes are low and there is volume loss in the right lower lobe. Again seen is a large rounded opacity in the right lower lung zone, consistent with known lung mass. Additional new nodules are seen superior to this primary mass, new from the prior study. There is extensive pleural calcificatoin on the left. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion. Osseous structures are intact.
