In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a right pleural catheter has changed in position in, and a moderate, partially loculated right pleural effusion has apparently minimally increased in size. Multifocal focal bilateral pulmonary opacities have slightly worsened in the interval, particularly in the right juxta hilar region and left retrocardiac area. No other relevant change.
