A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged in position compared the prior study. Lung volumes are slightly low resulting crowding of the pulmonary bronchovascular markings and an apparent mild increase in heart size. No pneumothorax, consolidation or pleural effusion seen. Visualized bony structures are unremarkable in appearance.
