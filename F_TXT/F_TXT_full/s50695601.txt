AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is normal. 1.7 x 1.1 cm oval opacity projecting over the right upper lung superimposed on the anterior end of the second rib. It might represent parenchymal versus rib process and oblique radiographs as well as lordotic view are required for further clarification. The rest of the lungs are essentially clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Alternatively for assessment of aorta and the lesion in the right hemithorax at the same time, chest CT might be considered.
