1. Interval decrease in size of a right-sided pneumothorax with basilar chest tube remaining in place. The right lung continues to appear heterogeneous in opacity consistent with the known right upper lobe mass and nodularity consistent with metastatic disease. Left lung is well inflated. There is a stable low-attenuation 5 mm nodular opacity lying along the inferior aspect of the fourth left posterior rib. The left lung is otherwise clear. No left effusion. The left heart border is unchanged. Evaluation of mediastinal contours is challenging given the entrapped right lung. No definite right effusion is appreciated.
