Following left thoracentesis, a left pleural effusion has nearly resolved, and there is no visible pneumothorax. Associated improving aeration at left lung base. Stable mild cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion. Worsening heterogeneous opacities in right mid and lower lung regions could reflect asymmetrical edema or infection. Interval slight repositioning of left PICC, with unusual bend at its distal point in the right tracheobronchial angle suggests the possibility of extension into the azygos vein. This could be further assessed by lateral CXR.
