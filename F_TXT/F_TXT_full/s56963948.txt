Comparison is made with prior study performed 13 hours earlier. Allowing the difference in technique and positioning of the patient, stable bilateral pleural effusions are moderate on the left and small-to-moderate on the right. Tracheostomy tube is in a standard position. Bibasilar atelectasis are larger on the left side. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position.
