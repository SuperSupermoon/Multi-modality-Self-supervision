Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates placement of endotracheal tube terminating at the level of the carina and should be withdrawn at least 3 cm to terminate at the level of the clavicle. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Bibasilar opacifications, left greater than right, may represent atelectasis, though infection is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax present.
