Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, perihilar opacities may relate to pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, underlying infection is not excluded. There are no large pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely accentuated by the low lung volumes and AP technique.
