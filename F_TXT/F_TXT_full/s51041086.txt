Right pigtail pleural catheter has slightly changed in position compared to the prior radiograph, but a loculated moderate-sized right pleural effusion is not appreciably changed. Adjacent parenchymal opacities in the right mid and lower lung have slightly worsened and probably represent atelectasis. Minor atelectasis is also demonstrated in the left retrocardiac area.
