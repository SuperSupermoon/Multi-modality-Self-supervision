As compared to a previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. As expected, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. There are now bilateral areas of parenchymal opacities reflecting atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly. No overt pulmonary edema is present. No pneumothorax. No pneumonia.
