Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates near complete opacification of the left hemithorax which likely represents a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. There is no major shift of the mediastinum. Over the interval, there has been slight increase in the right-sided pleural effusion, which is still small. A right IJ central venous line is seen with the tip terminating in the distal SVC.
