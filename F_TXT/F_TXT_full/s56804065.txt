1. Right dual lumen internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC at the cavoatrial junction. The endotracheal tube has its tip extending 4 cm above the carina. There is a nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach, although the side port is near the gastroesophageal junction. Advancement of the nasogastric tube would be advised as it does appear to have pulled back. There is persistent diffuse airspace disease in both lungs, right greater than left, which could reflect aspiration, pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Results were communicated to the patient's nurse, ___, on ___ at 9:32 a.m. by phone at the time of discovery.
