Chest, portable. There is a spiculated right hilar mass, with slightly denser adjacent hazy opacity. Another opacity in the left lower lung is actually a calcified pleural plaque based on the prior CT. The lungs are otherwise clear. The mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal. There are atherosclerotic calcifications in the aortic arch. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is noted. Increased lucency in the right upper lung is secondary to bullous emphysema as seen on the prior CT.
