AP portable upright view of the chest. Aortic valve replacement, midline sternotomy wires, and dual lead pacer appear unchanged. Right hemidiaphragmatic elevation is again noted. Curvilinear coarse calcifications projecting over the heart likely correspond with mitral annular calcification. The heart appears at least mildly enlarged. There is hilar congestion with probable mild interstitial pulmonary edema. No large effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The imaged bony structures appear intact.
