The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance with no interval development of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pleural thickening in the right lower lung is noted and might be consistent with prior post-surgical changes. Sternotomy wires are broken at the level of the first wire, unchanged. Left lower lobe linear opacity is seen and might potentially represent atelectasis, not clearly seen on the prior study, thus infectious process is a possibility (less likely). No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
