The ET tube is 3.7 cm above the Carina. There is moderate cardiomegaly. There is bilateral pleural effusions which are moderate in size. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution. There is a left upper lobe and right mid lung hazy alveolar infiltrate that could be partially due to volume loss and alveolar edema but an underlying infectious infiltrate can't be excluded
