1. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coiled within the stomach. A catheter overlying this location appears to be heading cephalad off the edge of the image but is felt to most likely be related to the balloon of the endotracheal tube as discussion with the patient's nurse, ___, confirms that the patient does not have any central venous access. 2. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits given portable technique. Lung volumes are relatively low with no evidence of pulmonary edema or focal airspace consolidation. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a small effusion or scarring. Calcification within the lateral neck soft tissues on the left may be carotid in etiology. 3. Clips in the right upper quadrant likely reflect prior cholecystectomy. Calcifications in the left upper quadrant likely represent splenic arterial calcifications.
