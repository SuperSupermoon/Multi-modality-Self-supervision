A pacemaker/AICD generator overlies the left chest wall. The leads appear intact and in standard position within the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. There are diffuse bilateral opacities with perihilar indistinctness and cardiac enlargement, findings compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. Evaluation for pleural effusion is limited due to the overlying pacer generator and the single portable view, though a small right pleural effusion is noted. No confluent consolidation is identified. There is no pneumothorax.
