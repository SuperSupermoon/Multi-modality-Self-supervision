In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the opacification on the right, consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the right middle lobe and apparent collapse of the right lower lobe. On the left, there is increased opacification in the mid to lower zone. This is worrisome for developing pneumonia. Due to the overlying opacifications, it is difficult to assess the degree of pulmonary edema. Left subclavian catheter tip remains in the mid SVC.
