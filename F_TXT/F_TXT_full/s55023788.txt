AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding supine chest examination of ___. The patient is intubated; the ETT is seen to terminate in the trachea, some 2 cm above the level of the carina. In comparison with the previous study, the chest tube has been advanced and is now closer to the carina than it was earlier. An NG tube is seen and reaches below the level of the diaphragm. Its final termination point cannot be identified as it exceeds the lower limit of the image. A previously described right internal jugular approach central venous line is again seen and terminates overlying the upper portion of the right atrium. Consider withdrawal by about 4 cm to ovoid contact with atrial structures as recommended already on the previous examination. The previously described bilateral pulmonary densities persist and most likely represent advanced congestion, but some additional parenchymal infiltrates cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax in the apical area.
