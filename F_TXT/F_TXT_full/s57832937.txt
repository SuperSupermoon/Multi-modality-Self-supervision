CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. There is rotated positioning. An orogastric J tube is present, though this is obscured in the lower mediastinum and upper abdomen and its tip is not demonstrated. Inspiratory volumes are probably slightly low, against a background of suspected COPD. Compared with ___, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably not significantly changed, allowing for technical differences. Blunting of both costophrenic angles is again seen. Minimal atelectasis at both bases is present. There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. Compared to the prior film, the CHF findings may have improved to a very small degree. Note is made of curvilinear lucency tracing the right heart border. This does not clearly represent a pneumothorax or mediastinal air and may be an artifact related to rotation and atelectasis, but is not fully evaluated on this view. Clips noted over lower neck on both sides with apparent straps versus drains over the soft tissues of the lower neck.
