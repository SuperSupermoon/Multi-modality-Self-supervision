In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been removed. Central catheter remains in the mid portion of the SVC. There is slight asymmetry of opacification at the bases, with mild opacification at the right. It is unclear whether this could merely reflect normal pulmonary vessels or mild atelectasis, since there is no obscuration of the hemidiaphragm or right heart border. If clinically possible, a lateral view would be most helpful for further evaluation. The nasogastric tube has also been removed.
