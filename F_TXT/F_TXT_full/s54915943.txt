There continues to be volume loss and infiltrate involving the right middle and right lower lobe with an alveolar infiltrate in the left upper lobe. the pulmonary vasculature is ill-defined and there is mild cardiomegaly. The appearance of the alveolar infiltrate on the left could be due to an unusual presentation of aymmetric pulmonary edema but could also be an infectious process. It appears similar to film from prior day. Right sided chest tube is unchanged. The pheumothorax is no longer vsulaized.
