CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. ET tube is obscured by the overlying GI tube, but probably lies approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. ___/orogastric type tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. A right IJ dual-lumen catheter tip is unchanged, overlying the distal SVC. Right-sided PICC line is present, tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Again seen is some patchy opacity at the left base, slightly worse, and a small left effusion. Minimal atelectasis at the right base. Upper zone redistribution may be slightly improved.
