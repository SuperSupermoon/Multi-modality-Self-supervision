Fine detail is obscured by thermal blanket over the patient. Left lower lobe, previously consolidated, is newly collapsed. Severe pneumonia persists in the right lower lobe. Upper lobes are grossly clear. Heart is normal size. There may be pleural effusion, but is not significant in size. ET tube, right internal jugular and subclavian line ends are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes as far as the diaphragm and out of view. No readily recognizable pneumothorax.
