CHEST AP SEMI-UPRIGHT Diffuse patchy bilateral parenchymal opacities are again seen. They are more marked than they were on the prior chest x-ray. A left effusion is present. The right effusion seen on the prior film is less apparent. Appearance would definitely be consistent with flash pulmonary edema, but widespread pneumonia could give a similar appearance.
