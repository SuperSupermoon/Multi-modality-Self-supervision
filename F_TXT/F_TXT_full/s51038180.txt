Compared to the study obtained approximately 3 hr earlier, the retrocardiac patchy opacity appears worse, likely reflective of worsening atelectasis. Mild atelectasis in the right lung base is unchanged. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip remains in the low SVC.
