The lungs are well inflated without focal opacities. The cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged from prior study and shown to be due to a prominent epicardial fat pad. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Degenerative changes of the bilateral AC joints are observed.
