Since the prior study there has been insertion of endotracheal tube which projects 4.5 cm from the carina. The enteric tube terminates in the left upper quadrant. Lung volumes are reduced since the prior study. There are new opacities at the right lung base with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which in combination likely suggest volume loss and atelectasis.
