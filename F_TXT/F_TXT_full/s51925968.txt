AP chest compared to ___: Previous mild pulmonary edema has largely cleared, but small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions have developed, presumably residual from cardiac decompensation. The postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is minimally larger, but this could be a function of removing positive pressure ventilator support. Right jugular sheath ends in the jugular vein. No pneumothorax.
