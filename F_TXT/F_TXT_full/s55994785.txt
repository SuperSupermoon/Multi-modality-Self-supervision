Assessment is limited by patient rotation. Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads in unchanged positions in the right atrium and right ventricle. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly appears grossly unchanged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted diffusely within the thoracic aorta. There is mild pulmonary edema, perhaps minimally worse compared to the previous examination. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present however the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. Patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect an area of atelectasis however infection cannot be excluded.
