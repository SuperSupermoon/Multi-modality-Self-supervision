As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices, including the left chest tube, are in unchanged position. There is minimally increasing density at the right lung bases, potentially suggesting minimal pleural effusion on the right. Unchanged elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Unchanged post-operative appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No overt pulmonary edema.
