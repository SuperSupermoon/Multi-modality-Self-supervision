Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Per the radiology technologist, unable to move or lift patient's head any higher. The patient's chin partially obscures the left lung apex. There are low lung volumes with minimal overlying atelectasis without definite focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
