An esophageal catheter courses into the stomach and into the right upper quadrant with acute curvature of the tip, suggesting placement in the proximal duodenum or looping within the gastric antrum. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is seen in the setting of low lung volumes. Heart and mediastinal contours are stable with top normal heart size. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this frontal view.
