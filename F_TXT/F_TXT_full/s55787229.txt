As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged bilateral basal opacities, left more than right, suggestive of atelectasis. Presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable. No pneumothorax, no pneumomediastinum. Two linear lucencies projecting over the left lung apex are caused by skin folds. The right internal jugular vein catheter is in constant position.
