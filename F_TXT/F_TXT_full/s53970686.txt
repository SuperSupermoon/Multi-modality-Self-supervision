As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase of the lung volumes, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. However, the overall lung volumes remain low and the moderate cardiomegaly that pre existed persists. Unchanged appearance of small right and left basilar atelectasis. Minimal fluid overload could be present but no overt pulmonary edema is seen. No new focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. No pneumothorax. The position of a right internal jugular vein catheter is unchanged.
