CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Supine positioning. The carina is not well-delineated. The ET tube lies between 3.7 and 4.7 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. A right IJ sheath is present. Left subclavian PICC line tip overlies distal SVC, unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There are small to moderate bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Allowing for differences in patient position (supine today, erect on the prior film), there is no definite interval change.
