The tip of the nasogastric tube is no longer pointing at the GE junction and appears to have been pulled back a few cm. Endotracheal tube tip is 6 cm above the carina appropriately sited. No pneumothoraces are seen. There is again seen an area of consolidation at the left mid and lower lung fields compatible with known pulmonary contusion. The left upper lobe and right base appear better aerated than on the prior study.
