Extensive bilateral opacities are noted, with near complete opacification of the entire right lung, better delineated on dedicated chest CT and suspicious for a multifocal infectious process. There is a small right pleural effusion as well as a moderate left pleural effusion. Known hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is again noted. There is no pneumothorax. No acute fractures identified.
