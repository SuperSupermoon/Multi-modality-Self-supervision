Comparison is made to prior examination of ___. The lung volumes are low. The heart size is therefore likely adequate. There is some widening of the mediastinum although again this is likely due to poor inspiratory effort. There is hazy opacity and vascular haziness in both lungs consistent with interstitial edema. An ET tube is identified 3.2 cm from the carina in correct position. A pacemaker lead in the right ventricle and a second lead in the right atrium. There is a subclavian line with its tip in the distal SVC. An NG tube is noted coursing through the esophagus into the stomach. The tip of the NG tube is not identified on this film.
