Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP technique. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. No pulmonary vascular engorgement or edema. Trace bilateral pleural effusions. Small left retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Moderate calcification of the aortic knob. Multiple dilated loops of bowel suggest ileus, though the bowel is incompletely evaluated on this study.
