AP chest compared to ___:19 a.m.: Over the past eight hours, cardiomegaly has improved substantially and pulmonary edema, previously mild-to-moderate, has substantially diminished.

Transvenous right atrial biventricular pacer defibrillator leads follow their expected courses. Dr. ___ was paged at 11:10 a.m. as soon as the findings were recognized.
