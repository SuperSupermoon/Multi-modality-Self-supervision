An endotracheal tube has been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube. The tracheostomy is directed towards the left lateral wall of the trachea and should be clinically evaluated for appropriate positioning. An enteric tube again terminates within the stomach. Right upper extremity PICC courses into the upper SVC. Pulmonary edema has resolved. A right pleural effusion is unchanged in volume. Heart remains mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax.
