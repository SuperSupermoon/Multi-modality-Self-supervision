Nasogastric tube passes to the stomach. A right IJ line extends to the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. There is increased opacity at the left lung base, possibly in part reflecting increased atelectasis, though developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. Aeration at the right lung base is also worsened, with new confluence laterally and obscuration of the diaphreagm. Hilar contours are prominent, though unchanged. The heart size is mildly enlarged, stable. There is calcification of the aortic knob and descending aorta, while sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are in unchanged alignment. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
