Compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, reflecting improved ventilation. There is minimal atelectasis at both lung bases but no evidence of a focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.
