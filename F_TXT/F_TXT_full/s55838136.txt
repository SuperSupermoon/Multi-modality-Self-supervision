AP chest compared to ___: Yesterday's chest radiograph showed mediastinal and pulmonary vascular congestion suggesting cardiac decompensation, and today, there is mild pulmonary edema in the right lung. Therefore, greater opacification at the left base is more likely to be a combination of atelectasis and edema than pneumonia, although infection is not excluded. The heart is normal size. No pneumothorax. Right subclavian line ends low in the SVC.
