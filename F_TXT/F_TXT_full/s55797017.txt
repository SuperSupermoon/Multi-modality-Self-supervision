The heart is again mild to moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The lung volumes are low. Patchy opacity obscuring the left costophrenic angle is probably due to atelectasis rather than pneumonia or pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is evident. Pulmonary vessels are relatively enlarged but well defined, perhaps with upper zone re-distribution, although probably unchanged and suggesting at most mild venous hypertension.
