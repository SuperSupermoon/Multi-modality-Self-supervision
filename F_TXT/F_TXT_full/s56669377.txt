No comparison. The lung volumes are low. Predominating in the left lower lobe as well as in the right and left lung apex is a subpleural pattern of parenchymal opacities with a reticular aspect. In addition, the lung parenchyma in the left lower lobe appears consolidated. The findings would be consistent with the presence of an interstitial lung disease. The additional consolidation on the left could be caused by a aspiration. CT should be performed to evaluate lung morphology. Mild cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
