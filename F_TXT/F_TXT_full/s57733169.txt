AP chest compared to ___: Tip of the endotracheal tube at the thoracic inlet is in standard position. Lung volumes are lower today and there is minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement. Atelectasis at the lung bases, particularly the left has increased. Pleural effusion small on the left if any. No pneumothorax. Heart size top normal. Nasogastric tube ends in the lower esophagus and would need to be advanced 15 cm to move all the side ports into moderately distended stomach. Subsequent radiograph, performed 6:09 a.m. and available at the time of this review shows that the tube was appropriately repositioned subsequently.
