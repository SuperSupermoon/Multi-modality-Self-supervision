The patient has been intubated. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear not significantly changed. Opacification at the right lung base is non-specific but could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia, and streaky opacification is also noted in the retrocardiac region that is not well assessed. There is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.
