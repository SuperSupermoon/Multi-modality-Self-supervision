AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained one day earlier (___). Cardiac enlargement and permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position with dual intracavitary electrode system appears unchanged. The previously described widespread fluffy densities interpreted as pulmonary edema are again identified. The on the next preceding examination (one day earlier) identified more homogenous density in the left upper lobe has regressed markedly apparently participating in the regression of the general pulmonary edema. This regression pattern in the previously suspected upper lobe infiltrate diminishes the suspicion for pneumonia and suggests that it is a portion of the widespread edematous patchy infiltrates in this patient with end-stage renal disease. No neumothorax has developed and with the exception of mild pleural blunting on the right base, no major evidence of pleural effusion exists.
