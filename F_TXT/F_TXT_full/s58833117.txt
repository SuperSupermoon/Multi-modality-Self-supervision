As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight decrease in extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion. The right parenchymal opacity at the lung bases, however, persists. Minimal increase in transparency at the left lung bases, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
