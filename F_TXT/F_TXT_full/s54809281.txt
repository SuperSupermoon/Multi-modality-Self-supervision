Right chest tube remains in place terminating at the extreme right lung apex medially, with a second tube projecting in the region of the thoracoabdominal junction. Moderate right apical pneumothorax has slightly decreased in size, with visceral apical pleural line now located just below the fourth posterior rib, and previously overlying the right fifth posterior rib. Adjacent postoperative changes are present related to recent bullectomy procedure, with decreasing opacity at the operative site, probably reflecting resolving contusion and atelectasis. Additional area of atelectasis is present at the right lung base adjacent to the low lying chest tube. On the left, note is made of apical bullous emphysema as well as a questionable subcentimeter nodular opacity in the periphery of the left upper lobe, in a region that is difficult to evaluate due to overlap of both the left scapula and the anterior fourth left rib. Attention to this area on a followup PA and lateral chest radiograph prior to discharge would be helpful to differentiate superimposition of normal structures from a true lung abnormality.
