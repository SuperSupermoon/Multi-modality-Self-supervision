I doubt significant interval change. Lines and tubes are similar. There is upper zone redistribution without overt CHF and bibasilar atelectasis. No frank consolidation or effusion identified. No pneumothorax detected. Possible mild cardiomegaly. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably similar allowing for differences in positioning. Lumbar spine fixation hardware again noted.
