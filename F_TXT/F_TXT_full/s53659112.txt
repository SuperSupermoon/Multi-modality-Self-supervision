Moderately diffuse left lung opacities have worsened whereas diffuse and mild right lung opacities are unchanged. Top normal heart size is similar but over last 24 hours there is widening of the upper mediastinum and pulmonary hila suggesting increased mediastinal and pulmonary vascular congestion. Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis is also worse. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Right PICC line tip is at lower SVC/cavoatrial junction. Tracheostomy tube is in position.
