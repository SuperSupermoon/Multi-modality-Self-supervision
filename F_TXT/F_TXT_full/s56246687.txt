There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter with the tip terminating at the level of the mid to lower SVC. The course of the line is unremarkable. There is unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Right basilar atelectasis is again seen. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated but appears enlarged. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is prominence of the main pulmonary artery suggesting underlying pulmonary hypertension. Calcification of the aortic knob is noted.
