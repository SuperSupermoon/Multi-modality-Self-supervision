Small left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. Perhaps minimal pulmonary vascular congestion. Otherwise, no significant change from the prior exam. There may be trace persistent right pleural effusion. Bilateral atelectasis persists. No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema. Stable prominent cardiomegaly. Stable calcification of the aortic arch. Stable mediastinal and hilar contours. Bilateral narrowing of the AC joint and high-riding humerus as well as heterotopic ossification superolateral to the right humeral head, suggesting chronic rotator cuff tear and severe osteoarthritis/post-trauma changes, are overall similar to prior shoulder radiographs.
