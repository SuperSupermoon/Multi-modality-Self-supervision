No previous images. There is a large gas gas-filled structure in the retrocardiac region, consistent with the clinical impression of left diaphragmatic hernia with a much of the stomach in the chest. Nasogastric tube has a somewhat unusual course, which could reflect the malpositioned stomach. The lower left lung is impossible to see on this frontal position due to the retrocardiac mass. Mild atelectatic changes and possible small effusion is seen at the right. There is asymmetry of the upper lungs with increased opacification on the right. This could possibly reflect an area of aspiration. A lateral view would be helpful when the condition of the patient permits. CT would better characterize the contents of the hernia.
