Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. Overlying trauma board slightly limit assessment. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is mild upper zone pulmonary vascular redistribution likely due to supine positioning without overt pulmonary edema. Minimal patchy opacities are noted in the upper lobes as well as the lower lobes bilaterally, which could reflect atelectasis or aspiration. Assessment of the left costophrenic angle is limited as it is excluded from the field of view. However, no large focal consolidation, gross pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. No displaced fractures are visualized.
