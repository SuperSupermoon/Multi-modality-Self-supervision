Evaluation of the radiograph is limited due to poor photon penetration. Within these limitations, the lungs are low in volume and show subtle retrocardiac lower lobe opacity. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. An ET tube terminates at the carina and should be withdrawn by at least 3 cm for optimal position. An NG tube passes out of view below the diaphragm.
