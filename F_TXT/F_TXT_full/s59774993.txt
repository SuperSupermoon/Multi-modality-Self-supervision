The heart size is normal. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and the hilar contour is stable. Previously appreciated consolidation which blurred the right heart border is mildly improved on today's study. The lungs are otherwise without effusion or pneumothorax. There is no subdiaphragmatic free air to suggest pneumoperitoneum. No acute bony changes identified.
