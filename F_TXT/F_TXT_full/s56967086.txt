Interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter courses into the left brachiocephalic vein, in inappropriate position. Recommend withdrawal and repositioning. No pneumothorax is seen. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is less prominent with improved lung volumes seen on the current study. Persistent left base opacity could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.
