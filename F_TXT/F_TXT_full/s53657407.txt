Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.5 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip terminates within the stomach. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is noted, with balloon projecting over the region of the stomach. The heart size is normal. The aortic knob is calcified. The lung volumes are low. Hazy ill-defined opacity is noted in the right lung, primarily the right perihilar region, findings which could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema though infection, aspiration, or hemorrhage is not excluded. No large pneumothorax is identified though a trace right pleural effusion may be present. Linear lucency through the posterior aspect of the right 1st rib is suggestive of a nondisplaced fracture.
