Diffuse interstitial pulmonary abnormality has worsened. I doubt this is pulmonary edema because the heart is normal size and mediastinal veins are not engorged. This could be a reaction to drugs or transfusion. If there is any concern about a disseminated micronodular pulmonary abnormality such as miliary tuberculosis or disseminated metastases, CT scanning should be performed.
