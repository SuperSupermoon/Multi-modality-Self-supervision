There is increasing patchy opacity at the right base which likely reflects a layering effusion with associated compressive atelectasis of the lower lobe. A superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. The left lung is grossly clear with the exception of a linear opacity in the left mid to lower lung which likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
