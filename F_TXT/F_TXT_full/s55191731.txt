A Swan-Ganz catheter is noted in the left descending pulmonary artery. Given the distal positioning, the catheter should be pulled back several centimeters to position it closer to the hilum. The multiple other supportive devices are unchanged in position. There is no significant change in the appearance of the lung parenchyma. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
