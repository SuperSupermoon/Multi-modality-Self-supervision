A single portable semi-erect view of the chest was obtained. In comparison to the prior study, there is increased moderate pulmonary edema with increased right basilar opacification likely related to increased edema. The heart is also increased in size compared to the prior study. There is interval placement of a right internal jugular venous catheter which terminates in the lower SVC. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, have increased. No pneumothorax.
