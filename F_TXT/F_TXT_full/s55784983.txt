A left-sided pacer and leads are in stable position. A chest tube overlies the right hemi thorax. Increased density at the apex of the right lung likely reflects atelectasis and possible, focal hemorrhage status post right upper lobe wedge resection. Bilateral pulmonary opacities and pulmonary vascular engorgement likely reflects chronic heart failure. No large pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
