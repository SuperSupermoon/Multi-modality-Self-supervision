Bilateral pulmonary opacities are slightly worsening consistent with atelectasis and increasing effusions, particularly on the right. Left-sided opacity projecting over the eighth posterior rib is again present but has no correlate to the recent chest CT. As previously postulated, this may be overlying skin lesion. There is no overt pulmonary edema or opacities concerning for an infectious process.
