Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Prominent mitral valvular calcification. There is calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. The left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated and there are streaky opacities throughout the left mid and lower lung favoring atelectasis rather than an infectious process. Clinical correlation is recommended. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
