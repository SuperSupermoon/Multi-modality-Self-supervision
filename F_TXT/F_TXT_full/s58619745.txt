Previously severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation has improved, particularly on the right they, were only an infra hilar component remains. Left lower lobe is densely consolidated and there is a lateral perihilar component which has improved only minimally. Small to moderate pleural effusions and moderate cardiomegaly are still present. A substantial component of the previous pulmonary abnormality was probably edema. What remains is indeterminate, but pneumonia should be kept in mind, until proved otherwise. ET tube, right internal jugular line, and nasogastric drainage tube are in standard placements. Right upper abdominal drain projects below the dome of the diaphragm.
