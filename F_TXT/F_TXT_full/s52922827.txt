A right IJ-approach Swan-Ganz catheter again terminates deep within a right pulmonary artery. A previously seen loop within the right ventricle has been resolved. There remains a smaller loop, likely coiled within the main pulmonary artery. A left-sided intracardiac device is unchanged in position. There is no pneumothorax. A left retrocardiac opacity is minimally changed, likely reflecting atelectasis.
