AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. Lung volumes are markedly low which limits the evaluation. Allowing for this, no definite sign of pneumonia, CHF, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Heart size appears grossly within normal limits. Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for slight hilar prominence. Bony structures appear intact.
