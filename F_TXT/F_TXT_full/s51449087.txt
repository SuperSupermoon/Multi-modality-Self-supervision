Low bilateral lung volumes. Perihilar and infrahilar airspace opacities are likely more conspicuous secondary to the low inspiratory lung volumes. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. No pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged. A small amount of free air is noted under the right hemidiaphragm. Air-filled loops of bowel project over the right upper quadrant as well as gaseous distention of the stomach. The the tip of the left internal jugular central venous catheter projects over the junction of the left brachiocephalic and left jugular vein, unchanged.
