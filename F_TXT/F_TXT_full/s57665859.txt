There are relatively low lung volumes. Large opacity projecting over the left mid to lower lung fields with subtle air bronchograms seen is worrisome for pneumonia. No definite pleural effusion is seen, although small left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. The right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
