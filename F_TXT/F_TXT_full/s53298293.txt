AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis performed in direct comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___, i.e. 11 hours earlier during the same day. The patient has now been intubated and ETT seen in the trachea to terminate some 4 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. Identified is also an intra-aortic balloon pump device in the aorta with the metallic tip reaching just to the lower contour of the aortic arch. Thus, the position is appropriate. No pneumothorax has developed in comparison with the previous study. Remarkable finding is a diffuse haze over the right hemithorax, more marked than on the left side. This may be explained by a shift of the interstitial edema pattern seen already on previous examination as faintly detectable interstitial edema. An explanation could be that the patient during the latest examination interval was mostly located on the right side explaining gravitational forces. There is no evidence of overall deterioration of the pulmonary congestion nor is there evidence of any new parenchymal infiltrate. An OG tube passes well through the esophagus and reaches into the stomach.
