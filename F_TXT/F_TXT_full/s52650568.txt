Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is slight increase in opacity at the right lung base as compared to the prior study, raising concern for underlying consolidation and this could be better evaluated with addition of lateral view. There is sclerosis at the posterolateral right eighth rib, question of prior rib fracture. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
