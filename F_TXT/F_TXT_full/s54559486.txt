Single frontal semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates stable prominent interstitial markings and known post-radiation paramediastinal fibrosis particularly evident in the left upper lung. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is stable cardiac enlargement which may represent cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
