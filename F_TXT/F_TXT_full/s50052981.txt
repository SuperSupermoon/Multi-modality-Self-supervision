A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained reportedly. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. A right Port-A-Cath is again seen, although the tip is not well visualized. A chest tube overlies the right hemithorax. A right pleural density is a loculated effusion. No new opacity. A tiny right pneumothorax is newly apparent. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Barium from recent esophagram is noted.
