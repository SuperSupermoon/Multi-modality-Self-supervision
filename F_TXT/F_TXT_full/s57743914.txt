1. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. There continue to be bibasilar airspace opacities with likely associated pleural effusions suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. There is asymmetry in the perihilar vasculature, right being more pronounced than the left, which is of uncertain clinical significance, though could indicate a component of asymmetric perihilar edema. Followup imaging would be advised. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning.
