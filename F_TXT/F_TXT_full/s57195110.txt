Interval placement of a left-sided internal jugular central venous line with the tip projecting over the expected location of the superior SVC. No pneumothorax. Lung volumes are mildly decreased leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Mild-pulmonary edema and central pulmonary vascular congestion is grossly unchanged. Probable trace right pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities are noted which likely represent atelectasis. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
