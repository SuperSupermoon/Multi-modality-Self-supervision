AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study ___ ___. A tracheostomy cannula is seen in place apparently to substitute for the previously present ETT. The cannula is in appropriate position, terminating in the trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax is seen. NG tube is identified, seen to pass well below the diaphragm and through the stomach with its distal end, assuming the curvature of the pancreas head, terminating in the proximal jejunum. This appears to be in similar position as a tube identified on ___, although its distal termination is not completely identified in the previous examination.
