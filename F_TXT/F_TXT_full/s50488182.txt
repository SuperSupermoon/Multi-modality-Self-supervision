Compared to 1 day earlier, the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly smaller, though this is in part due to technical differences. Again seen is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Hazy opacity at both lung bases is again noted, slightly less pronounced. Possible small right and very small left effusion, also appear slightly improved. Again seen is a catheter overlying the lower chest and upper abdomen, for which clinical correlation is requested. No pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pneumo pericardium detected.
