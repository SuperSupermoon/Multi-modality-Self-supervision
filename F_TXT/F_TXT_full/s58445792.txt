AP chest compared to preoperative chest radiograph, ___: Right apical pleural tube in place. Postoperative right lung well expanded, with no apparent persistent pleural space. Opacification medial to the right upper lung abutting the mediastinum is probably hematoma, particularly given leftward displacement of the trachea. Small left pleural effusion is new, probably not clinically significant. Heart size is normal.
