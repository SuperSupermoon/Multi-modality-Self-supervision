In comparison with the study of ___, there has been some decrease in the opacification of the right hemithorax. This is consistent with some improvement in pulmonary vascular status in a patient with cardiac enlargement, dual-channel pacer device, and extensive calcification in the region of the mitral valve and atrium. There is a residual more focal area of opacification at the right base. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent a region of consolidation.
