There has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter which projects over the mid SVC. Lung volumes are low with increased hazy perihilar opacities, consistent with pulmonary edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Otherwise, no significant change compared to the prior study.
