Left hemi thorax is nearly completely opacified by a very large mediastinal mass projecting to the left of midline and associated with rightward cardiomediastinal shift. Coexisting left pleural effusion is difficult to quantify in the setting of such a large mediastinal mass, but overall appearance is similar to the scout image from the CT scan.
