Interval appearance of pneumoperitoneum consistent with known recent surgery. Lung volumes are low with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis. There may be a small right effusion. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given patient rotation and portable technique.
