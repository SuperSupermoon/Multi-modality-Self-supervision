There has been interval placement of a stent in the left lower lobe bronchus, though the stent is not visualized on this radiographic examination. Prior left lower lobe collapse has resolved in the interval. The remainder of the lungs appear clear. No large pleural effusion is identified. Mild prominence of the hila bilaterally is secondary to known adenopathy. Barium is seen within the colon in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
