There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter with tip in the mid SVC. No large pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. Endotracheal tube and enteric tubes are in unchanged positions. Worsening pulmonary opacities in the perihilar regions and upper lung fields bilaterally may reflect a combination of worsening mild pulmonary edema and atelectasis. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Superior mediastinal widening may be due to low lung volumes and supine AP positioning. Catheter terminating in the region of the T1 vertebral body again is unchanged, possibly a temperature probe, with cervical spinal hardware partially imaged.
