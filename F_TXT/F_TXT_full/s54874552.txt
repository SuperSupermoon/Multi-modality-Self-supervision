The lung volumes are somewhat low. Diffuse opacity is seen in the bilateral lungs, predominantly in the bases, with a predominantly alveolar configuration. This pattern is most consistent with aspiration. Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
