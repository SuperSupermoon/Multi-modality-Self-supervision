As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carina. The tube could be minimally advanced, by approximately 1 cm. The radiograph is otherwise unchanged. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta but no evidence of larger pleural effusions, pneumonia or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
