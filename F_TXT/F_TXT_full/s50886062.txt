Relative opacity projecting over the mid to lower thorax bilaterally most likely relates to overlying soft tissue although underlying pleural effusion or consolidation is difficult to exclude on this study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable, with the cardiac silhouette top-normal to mildly enlarged. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. No overt pulmonary edema.
