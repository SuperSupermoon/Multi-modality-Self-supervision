Tip of the endotracheal tube is less than 2 cm from the carina and should be withdrawn 2 cm for standard positioning. Poor definition of the airway, particular right main bronchus suggest retained secretions. Lungs are low in volume but clear. Normal cardiomediastinal contours. Pneumomediastinum is mild if any, and has not progressed since earlier study. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
