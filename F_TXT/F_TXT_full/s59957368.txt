Lung volumes are low, which leads to bronchovascular crowding. Poorly defined opacities in the left mid and lower lung are new, superimposed on pre-existing linear scarring. Left hemidiaphragm remains mildly elevated compared to the right. There is no pneumothorax, but left apex is obscured by overlying soft tissue structures of the chin and neck, precluding assessment for left apical pneumothorax or parenchymal process in this region.
