As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line has been pulled back by approximately 3-4 cm. The tip of the line is now located at the level of the upper SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the chest radiograph is unchanged, including the known right pleural effusion and the right upper lobe mass.
