Tracheostomy tube is in the midline, unchanged from prior. The right PICC line has been repositioned, looping in the internal jugular vein and terminating in the right brachiocephalic vein. Diffuse opacification in the right hemithorax is unchanged. The left mid lung opacity obscuring the left heart border is more prominent. This is partially due to the lung lesion seen on recent CT, but postobstructive pneumonia cannot be ruled out. Small pleural effusion on the right is unchanged. No pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
