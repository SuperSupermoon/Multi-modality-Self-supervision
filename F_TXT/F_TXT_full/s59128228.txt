Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for lower lung volumes. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by interstitial edema. Worsening bibasilar opacities are present, left greater than right, and probably represent atelectasis. Co-existing aspiration and infectious pneumonia are possible in the appropriate clinical settings. Small left pleural effusion is noted.
