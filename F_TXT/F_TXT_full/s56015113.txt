AP chest read in conjunction with most recent chest imaging, a CT on ___: Relative hyperlucency of the entire right hemithorax could be due to prior right mastectomy. There may be a very small component of pleural air laterally in the lower chest. Right basal pleural tube extends from the lateral costal surface to the midline. Small left pleural effusion or pleural thickening is present. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pulmonary edema. Conventional view chest radiographs, PA and lateral, would be more helpful in excluding pneumothorax whose presence could be obscured by the features of extensive mastectomy.
