AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained nine hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. The same holds for the previously described right internal jugular approach central venous line. During the interval, left-sided thoracocentesis has been performed and the previously described increasing left-sided pleural effusion has been eliminated almost completely. No left-sided lateral pleural sinus can now be identified. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the left-sided apical area. Comparison of the pulmonary circulation suggests that the previously identified pulmonary perivascular haze has decreased mildly. No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be identified.
