Compared to the most recent study, the left hemidiaphragmatic contour is now better defined, indication that the left pleural effusion and atelectasis are improving. There are linear opacities surrounding the mediastinum, consistent with chronic radiation changes. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no frank pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size is normal and the mediastinal width is unchanged. A left PICC has been removed.
