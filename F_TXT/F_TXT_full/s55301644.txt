There is a new NG tube. Gas is still seen in a slightly distended stomach, but it is no longer as severely distended as on the prior film. There continues to be dense retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate. Left chest tube is in place. Pleural thickening/effusion is again seen bilaterally. Scarring in the right upper lung is again visualized.
