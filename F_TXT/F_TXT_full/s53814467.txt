Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with a tiny right apical pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube terminates within the intrathoracic neoesophagus, and an endotracheal tube has been removed. Stable postoperative cardiomediastinal widening.

Small right pleural effusion has increased in size since the previous study and is accompanied by atelectasis at the right base.
