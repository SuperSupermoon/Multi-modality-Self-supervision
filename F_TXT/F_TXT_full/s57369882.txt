Single portable AP view through the chest demonstrates an ET tube in appropriate position, tip ~4cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen descending along the expected course of the esophagus, its distal tip not included in the field of view. Lungs are hyperinflates. There is patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe. Left lower lobe opacity as well as more subtle opacity in the RLLL also concerning for pneumonia/aspiration. No parge effusion or ptx. The hilar and mediastinal contour is within normal limits. The heart is normal in size. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
