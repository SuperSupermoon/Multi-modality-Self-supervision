Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new right internal jugular central venous line with the tip of the catheter 5.5 cm inferior to the carina. FOr more optimal positioning, it should be retracted by roughly 15mm. No pneumothorax is seen. Otherwise, the lung volumes are reduced, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature and cardiac contour. No good evidence for pulmonary edema or effusions. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.
