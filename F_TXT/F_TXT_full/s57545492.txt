Overall little change in comparison to the prior study with continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and silhouetting of the right heart border as well as increased opacity in the right retrocardiac region. There is at least partial right lower and middle lobe atelectasis. Cardiomegaly remains stable. Left PICC is visualized in the left brachiocephalic vein. Tracheostomy tube is shifted to the left due to a large superior mediastinal mass shown to be related to the thyroid gland on prior CT scan. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt traversing over the right hemithorax appears stable.
