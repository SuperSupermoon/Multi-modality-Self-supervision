Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3.8 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are just below the GE junction. Heart size is upper limits of normal. There is some mild prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings and some mild widening of the vascular pedicle, suggestive of minimal pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation or pleural effusions are seen. There is irregularity of the left proximal humerus suggestive of prior old trauma with secondary osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint.
