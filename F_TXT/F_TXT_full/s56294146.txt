As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Also unchanged is the alignment of the sternal wires and the course of the pacemaker leads. The previously seen multifocal parenchymal opacities have decreased in extent and severity. However, bilateral lower lung volumes are noted, and there is minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, potentially suggesting small pleural effusions. Retrocardiac atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax. To assess the presence and extent of tension pleural effusions, a lateral radiograph would be helpful.
