Right-sided PICC terminates in the region of the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. Multifocal bilateral pulmonary opacities have increased in the interval, which may be due to increased pulmonary edema or infectious process, on a background of chronic pulmonary opacities. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
