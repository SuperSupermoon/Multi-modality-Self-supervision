The tip of the endotracheal tube is 4 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a right sided central venous line with distal tip in the mid SVC. There is an enteric tube with sideport and tip below the GE junction. There is a left-sided pacemaker with a single lead tip in the right ventricle. Heart size is enlarged. There are diffuse airspace opacities similar to the prior study. There is mild improved aeration of the right base. This may represent multifocal pneumonia; however, superimposed pulmonary edema is also possible. There are no pneumothoraces.
