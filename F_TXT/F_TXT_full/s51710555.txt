Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Bilateral juxtahilar alveolar opacities appear less symmetric on the current study, with increasing confluence on the left compared to the right. This could represent asymmetrical edema, particularly in the setting of co-existing interstitial opacities, but superimposed process in the left lung such as aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia is also possible, and followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions appear slightly increased compared to the prior exam.
