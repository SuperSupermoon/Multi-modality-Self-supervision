AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___. Permanent pacer is noted in left anterior chest wall position, unchanged. The same holds for the two intracavitary electrodes seen to terminate in right atrial and right ventricular positions. Heart size is unchanged and moderately enlarged. Pulmonary vasculature is not congested, and the on previous examination identified infiltrates occupying the central portion of the left lung and right more basally located infiltrates blending with the right cardiac contours have normalized. Thus, presently there is no evidence for an acute pulmonary infection as can be identified on this single AP portable chest view. Lateral pleural sinuses are free as before. Patient's drooping chin conceals partially the apical area, but there is no suspicion for any pneumothorax.
