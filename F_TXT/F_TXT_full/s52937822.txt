There has been interval removal of the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes. A catheter projects over the left hemithorax. The right internal jugular introducer remains with the tip in the upper SVC. Considerable fracture of the wires at the upper sternum is a preoperative finding. Lung volumes are improved. Left lung opacification has improved although left basilar atelectasis and small pleural effusion have slightly increased after extubation. The right lung is clear. No appreciable pneumothorax. The mediastinum is less wide. Moderate cardiomegaly is similar to the prior study.
