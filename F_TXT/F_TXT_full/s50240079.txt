New transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer leads have been inserted from the new left pectoral generator. The transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead is unchanged in position but its connection is not clear. Moderate cardiomegaly is probably unchanged given the difference between PA and AP projections. There is no pneumothorax pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
