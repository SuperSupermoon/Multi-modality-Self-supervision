Interval intubation with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 3.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube remains in place. Stable widening of cardiomediastinal contours and persistent moderate-to-large left and small right layering effusions. Bilateral retrocardiac opacities are unchanged and probably reflect atelectasis with or without coexisting contusion in this patient with recent trauma. Numerous left rib fractures are present, and have been demonstrated to better detail on prior outside CT of ___. In the setting of left rib fractures and an enlarging left effusion, hemothorax should be considered.
