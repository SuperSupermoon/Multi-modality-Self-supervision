The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged. The aorta is calcified. Perihilar opacities may relate to enlargement of the pulmonary arteries and vascular engorgement. A more confluent opacity at the right lung base and is seen and an underlying infection is not excluded. There is persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Difficult to exclude a small right pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax.
