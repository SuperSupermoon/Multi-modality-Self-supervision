As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, cardiomegaly is accompanied by worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. Worsening interstitial opacities in small pleural effusions are likely due to hydrostatic edema and less likely an atypical pneumonia. No definite new or worsening areas of consolidation to suggest bacterial pneumonia.
