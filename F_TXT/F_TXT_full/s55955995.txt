Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip lies within the proximal right atrium. No pneumothorax is identified. Endotracheal and enteric tubes remain in similar positions. Lung volumes remain low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures and probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases appear slightly worse in the interval, and again may reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion is identified.
