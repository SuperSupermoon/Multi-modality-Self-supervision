In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a left internal jugular catheter has been slightly withdrawn, now terminating in the left brachiocephalic vein just proximal to the superior vena cava. Right lower lobe opacity has nearly resolved in the interval, and a left retrocardiac opacification has worsened with persistent adjacent small left pleural effusion. No other relevant change.
