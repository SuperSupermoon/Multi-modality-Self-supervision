Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomegaly is stable. There are low lung volumes. Left lower lobe collapse is unchanged. Right perihilar opacities have improved. Right upper lobe opacities also improved. Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion is probably unchanged allowing for the differences in positioning of the patient. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. ET tube tip in a standard position. The tip is 3.4 cm above the carina. There is no pneumothorax.
