Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Diffuse bilateral infiltrates are stable over the interval, and likely represent a combination of atelectasis and pulmonary edema. There has been interval removal of the right-sided chest tube. Dense retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis. Small left-sided pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax. Subcutaneous gas in the bilateral supraclavicular soft tissues is slightly increased as compared to the prior.I
