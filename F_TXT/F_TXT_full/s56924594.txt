AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: This is an extremely abnormal chest radiograph with many equivocal findings. I do not see a radiopaque airway. The trachea may be displaced to the right by an abnormality of the aorta. Pulmonary arteries are quite large and the left one is elevated. Mild pulmonary edema seems to be present. The heart is at least mildly enlarged. I would strongly recommend CT scanning to clarify all of these findings. Dr. ___ was paged.
