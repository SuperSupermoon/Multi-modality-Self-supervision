IMPRESSION: 
 
 EXAMINATION: centered at the diaphragm excludes the right lateral chest and
 upper abdomen. Nasogastric tube scans in the nondistended stomach. Imaged
 portion of the left lung is clear.  Hazy opacification at the periphery of the
 right chest is probably due to pleural thickening associated with rib
 fractures but there may be a new right pleural effusion. Heart is normal size.
